# WARP.md

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository is designed for analyzing scientific podcasts about cancer and diet research. The primary goal is to fact-check claims made in podcast episodes against peer-reviewed literature and build a knowledge base of verified scientific information.

## Repository Structure

- `episodes/` - Individual podcast episode breakdowns and analysis
- `research/` - Supporting research papers, citations, and scientific references  
- `docs/` - Documentation, methodology, and analysis frameworks

## Common Research Tasks

Since this is a research-focused repository, common operations involve:

- Creating episode analysis documents in `episodes/`
- Adding research papers and citations to `research/`
- Documenting methodology and frameworks in `docs/`

## File Organization Guidelines

**Episode Analysis Files:**
- Name format: `YYYY-MM-DD-podcast-name-episode-title.md`
- Should include: episode metadata, claims identified, fact-checking results, citations

**Research Files:**
- Include DOI links and proper academic citations
- Organize by topic areas (e.g., nutrition, oncology, epidemiology)
- Use consistent naming for easy cross-referencing

**Documentation:**
- Maintain methodology documentation for consistent fact-checking approaches
- Keep citation standards and formatting guidelines

## Git Workflow

This is a content-focused repository where changes typically involve:
- Adding new episode analyses
- Updating research findings
- Expanding documentation

The project uses standard git practices with descriptive commit messages for tracking research progress.

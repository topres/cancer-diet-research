cancer is very preventable when the cancer is very preventable when the cancer is very preventable when the medical establishment acknowledge what I medical establishment acknowledge what I medical establishment acknowledge what I know about this disorder what's causing know about this disorder what's causing know about this disorder what's causing it and what we're not doing to prevent it and what we're not doing to prevent it and what we're not doing to prevent it or treated it it will be recognized it or treated it it will be recognized it or treated it it will be recognized as the greatest tragedy in the history as the greatest tragedy in the history as the greatest tragedy in the history of medicine Thomas CA freed is a of medicine Thomas CA freed is a of medicine Thomas CA

biochemistry who has dedicated the past 30 years Gathering scientific evidence 30 years Gathering scientific evidence 30 years Gathering scientific evidence on what could be the true origin and on what could be the true origin and on what could be the true origin and prevention of cancer cancer is getting prevention of cancer cancer is getting prevention of cancer cancer is getting worse and there's no major advance in worse and there's no major advance in worse and there's no major advance in reducing death rates and I can speak to reducing death rates and I can speak to reducing death rates and I can speak to the reasons for that all major cancer the reasons for that all major cancer the reasons for that all major cancer research PL think cancer is a genetic research PL think cancer is a genetic research PL think cancer is a genetic disease you believe otherwise it's not disease you believe otherwise it's not disease you believe otherwise it's not whether you believe it's what the data whether you believe it's what the data whether you believe it's what the data tell us and the evidence is massive to tell us and the evidence is massive to tell us and the evidence is massive to support that cancer is a metabolic support that cancer is a metabolic support that cancer is a metabolic disorder and the problem is we're doing disorder and the problem is we're doing disorder and the problem is we're doing everything we possibly can in our everything we possibly can in our everything we possibly can in our lifestyle to induce it the scientific lifestyle to induce it the scientific lifestyle to induce it the scientific evidence is there like for example we evidence is there like for example we evidence is there like for example we know that cancer was extremely rare in know that cancer was extremely rare in know that cancer was extremely rare in African tribes that were living African tribes that were living African tribes that were living according to the traditional ways but according to the traditional ways but according to the traditional ways but when modern lifestyle entered into their when modern lifestyle entered into their when modern lifestyle entered into their societies cancer out of control we even societies cancer out of control we even societies cancer out of control we even did a study on THS we know that wolves did a study on THS we know that wolves did a study on THS we know that wolves in the wild don't die from cancer but in the wild don't die from cancer but in the wild don't die from cancer but cancer is the number one killer of cancer is the number one killer of cancer is the number one killer of domestic dogs why it's because of our domestic dogs why it's because of our domestic dogs why it's because of our lifestyle issues and a lot of us are lifestyle issues and a lot of us are lifestyle issues and a lot of us are doing things without the knowledge that doing things without the knowledge that doing things without the knowledge that it would put us at risk but with it would put us at risk but with it would put us at risk but with metabolic therapy you can use it as both metabolic therapy you can use it as both metabolic therapy you can use it as both a prevention and a treatment and we're a prevention and a treatment and we're a prevention and a treatment and we're seeing more and more of terminal cancer seeing more and more of terminal cancer seeing more and more of terminal cancer patients outliving their patients outliving their patients outliving their predictabilities because of this and let predictabilities because of this and let predictabilities because of this and let me tell you one thing and remember it if me tell you one thing and remember it if me tell you one thing and remember it if you do metabolic therapy you can you do metabolic therapy you can you do metabolic therapy you can actually reduce risk for cancer you can actually reduce risk for cancer you can actually reduce risk for cancer you can take away the fear and when you say take away the fear and when you say take away the fear and when you say metabolic therapy tell me what those metabolic therapy tell me what those metabolic therapy tell me what those things are number one before this episode starts I have a before this episode starts I have a before this episode starts I have a small

literate in in various scientific literate in in various scientific literate in in various aspects of biology the research program aspects of biology the research program aspects of biology the research program that we have at the University is also that we have at the University is also that we have at the University is also Focus fed on understanding uh how to Focus fed on understanding uh how to Focus fed on understanding uh how to manage cancer better how it originates manage cancer better how it originates manage cancer better how it originates and how to prevent it how much of a and how to prevent it how much of a and how to prevent it how much of a problem is cancer globally what are the problem is cancer globally what are the problem is cancer globally what are the sort of headline statistics on the macro sort of headline statistics on the macro sort of headline statistics on the macro view of cancer for someone that really view of cancer for someone that really view of cancer for someone that really doesn't know yeah well it's getting doesn't know yeah well it's getting doesn't know yeah well it's getting worse uh I can't say there it's in the worse uh I can't say there it's in the worse uh I can't say there it's in the millions I I I know precisely what's millions I I I know precisely what's millions I I I know precisely what's going on in this country because the going on in this country because the going on in this country because the American Cancer Society uh every year uh American Cancer Society uh every year uh American Cancer Society uh every year uh distributes the data on on cancer um we distributes the data on on cancer um we distributes the data on on cancer um we have almost two million new cases have almost two million new cases have almost two million new cases diagnosed per year in the United diagnosed per year in the United diagnosed per year in the United States and we have 1,700 people a day States and we have 1,700 people a day States and we have 1,700 people a day dying from cancer in in the United dying from cancer in in the United dying from cancer in in the United States which comes to about 70 people States which comes to about 70 people States which comes to about 70 people per hour in the United States now when I per hour in the United States now when I per hour in the United States now when I went to China I looked at some numbers went to China I looked at some numbers went to China I looked at some numbers there and it was there and it was there and it was 8,000 people a day are dying from cancer 8,000 people a day are dying from cancer 8,000 people a day are dying from cancer obviously the population is so much obviously the population is so much obviously the population is so much larger larger larger and uh I don't know what it is in the UK and uh I don't know what it is in the UK and uh I don't know what it is in the UK I mean we'd have to go to their cancer I mean we'd have to go to their cancer I mean we'd have to go to their cancer Registries but but what we do know is Registries but but what we do know is Registries but but what we do know is that it's supposed to be a lot worse by that it's supposed to be a lot worse by that it's supposed to be a lot worse by 2050 than it is today so there seems to 2050 than it is today so there seems to 2050 than it is today so there seems to be no reduction in death suffering for be no reduction in death suffering for be no reduction in death suffering for this disease and I I can speak to the this disease and I I can speak to the this disease and I I can speak to the the reasons for that but right now I the reasons for that but right now I the reasons for that but right now I would say it's a global uh epidemic of would say it's a global uh epidemic of would say it's a global uh epidemic of cancer it's not it's not getting better cancer it's not it's not getting better cancer it's not it's not getting better it's getting worse more people are dying it's getting worse more people are dying it's getting worse more people are dying from it there's no major advance in in from it there's no major advance in in from it there's no major advance in in reducing death rates so it's a great reducing death rates so it's a great reducing death rates so it's a great tragedy so um and when we when we tragedy so um and when we when we tragedy so um and when we when we understand what's causing it and what understand what's causing it and what understand what's causing it and what we're not doing to prevent it or treat we're not doing to prevent it or treat we're not doing to prevent it or treat it it'll it'll be recognized as the it it'll it'll be recognized as the it it'll it'll be recognized as the singular greatest

worldwide when it when when they come to know what I know about when they come to know what I know about when they come to know what I know about this disorder and then they realize what this disorder and then they realize what this disorder and then they realize what we've been doing in in in in in a we've been doing in in in in in a we've been doing in in in in in a misdirected way it will be recognized as misdirected way it will be recognized as misdirected way it will be recognized as the greatest tragedy in the history of the greatest tragedy in the history of the greatest tragedy in the history of medicine what Tye types of cancer are medicine what Tye types of cancer are medicine what Tye types of cancer are people dying from what is the most people dying from what is the most people dying from what is the most popular types of cancer for men and popular types of cancer for men and popular types of cancer for men and women well it's always been lung cancer women well it's always been lung cancer women well it's always been lung cancer pretty much for men and women uh lung pretty much for men and women uh lung pretty much for men and women uh lung cancer has always been the number one cancer has always been the number one cancer has always been the number one but but we have pancreatic breast cancer but but we have pancreatic breast cancer but but we have pancreatic breast cancer colon cancer these are all on the rise colon cancer these are all on the rise colon cancer these are all on the rise colon cancer is on the rise pancreatic colon cancer is on the rise pancreatic colon cancer is on the rise pancreatic cancer is on the rise in this country I cancer is on the rise in this country I cancer is on the rise in this country I I I I can't speak for other countries I I I can't speak for other countries I I I can't speak for other countries they may dare very slightly due to diet they may dare very slightly due to diet they may dare very slightly due to diet lifestyle issues but lung cancer has lifestyle issues but lung cancer has lifestyle issues but lung cancer has always been recognized as as the number always been recognized as as the number always been recognized as as the number one cancer how many people in the United one cancer how many people in the United one cancer how many people in the United States then based on the statistics States then based on the statistics States then based on the statistics would develop cancer well it seems to would develop cancer well it seems to would develop cancer well it seems to increase every year so it's kind of a increase every year so it's kind of a increase every year so it's kind of a moving Target it doesn't seem to go down moving Target it doesn't seem to go down moving Target it doesn't seem to go down you know what it is today I don't know you know what it is today I don't know you know what it is today I don't know but what I do know is the numbers of but what I do know is the numbers of but what I do know is the numbers of people that are dying each day because people that are dying each day because people that are dying each day because the um American Cancer Society comes out the um American Cancer Society comes out the um American Cancer Society comes out with I think it's 612,000 with I think it's 612,000 with I think it's 612,000 people uh will die this year people uh will die this year people uh will die this year 2024 uh from cancer 2024 uh from cancer 2024 uh from cancer in this year so divide it by 365 and it in this year so divide it by 365 and it in this year so divide it by 365 and it comes out to just about 1,700 people a comes out to just about 1,700 people a comes out to just about 1,700 people a day divide that number by 24 and you get day divide that number by 24 and you get day divide that number by 24 and you get about 70 people an hour based on the about 70 people an hour based on the about 70 people an hour based on the numbers provided to us from the American numbers provided to us from the American numbers provided to us from the American Cancer Society when they say we've made Cancer Society when they say we've made Cancer Society when they say we've made major advances in man in cancer major advances in man in cancer major advances in man in cancer incidences right so in the 1990s they incidences right so in the 1990s they incidences right so in the 1990s they instituted the uh anti-smoking campaigns instituted the uh anti-smoking campaigns instituted the uh anti-smoking campaigns all right so today if you read they say all right so today if you read they say all right so today if you read they say we have reduced cancer deaths by 30 31 we have reduced cancer deaths by 30 31 we have reduced cancer deaths by 30 31 or 32% wow that sounds really impressive or 32% wow that sounds really impressive or 32% wow that sounds really impressive so what they do is they take the number so what they do is they take the number so what they do is they take the number this is what the national the American this is what the national the American this is what the national the American Cancer Society has done and published in Cancer Society has done and published in Cancer Society has done and published in their papers okay if we didn't stop their papers okay if we didn't stop their papers okay if we didn't stop smoking in the 90s and everybody smoking in the 90s and everybody smoking in the 90s and everybody continued to smoke the trajectory would continued to smoke the trajectory would continued to smoke the trajectory would be very very high because we stopped be very very high because we stopped be very very high because we stopped smoking or this it's we have 33% lower smoking or this it's we have 33% lower smoking or this it's we have 33% lower death than if we didn't stop smoking but death than if we didn't stop smoking but death than if we didn't stop smoking but the trajectory is continuing to increase the trajectory is continuing to increase the trajectory is continuing to increase maybe not as steep as it would have been maybe not as steep as it would have been maybe not as steep as it would have been had we continued to smoke so it's it was had we continued to smoke so it's it was had we continued to smoke so it's it was clearly a prevention it had nothing to clearly a prevention it had nothing to clearly a prevention it had nothing to do with a a treatment it had to do with do with a a treatment it had to do with do with a a treatment it had to do with prevention that was giving the the the prevention that was giving the the the prevention that was giving the the the oh we've made major advances in in oh we've made major advances in in oh we've made major advances in in reducing cancer death rate yeah because reducing cancer death rate yeah because reducing cancer death rate yeah because people sto smoking for the mo for many people sto smoking for the mo for many people sto smoking for the mo for many many people more people would have died many people more people would have died many people more people would have died had they not smoked so we have um people had they not smoked so we have um people had they not smoked so we have um people that are not not real people we're just that are not not real people we're just that are not not real people we're just looking at what would have happened if looking at what would have happened if looking at what would have happened if if we didn't stop smoking what are the if we didn't stop smoking what are the if we didn't stop smoking what are the leading causes of death worldwide in leading causes of death worldwide in leading causes of death worldwide in terms of diseases is is I I hear that terms of diseases is is I I hear that terms of diseases is is I I hear that heart disease is number one I think heart disease is number one I think heart disease is number one I think that's heart disease is number one uh that's heart disease is number one uh that's heart disease is number one uh cancer is number two okay and there are cancer is number two okay and there are cancer is number two okay and there are many different types of cancer right many different types of cancer right many different types of cancer right there's hundreds of different forms of there's hundreds of different forms of there's hundreds of different forms of cancer if you look under the electron cancer if you look under the electron cancer if you look under the electron microscope or a correction even a light microscope or a correction even a light microscope or a correction even a light micro this is how most cancers are micro this is how most cancers are micro this is how most cancers are diagnosed by by light diagnosed by by light diagnosed by by light microscopy uh you look under the microscopy uh you look under the microscopy uh you look under the microscope and you see a bunch of cells microscope and you see a bunch of cells microscope and you see a bunch of cells that are dysmorphic in the way they look that are dysmorphic in the way they look that are dysmorphic in the way they look and then they all have genetic defects and then they all have genetic defects and then they all have genetic defects and all this kind of stuff but they all and all this kind of stuff but they all and all this kind of stuff but they all have one thing in common they depend on have one thing in common they depend on have one thing in common they depend on a on a fermentation energy without a on a fermentation energy without a on a fermentation energy without oxygen so all cancers are a singular oxygen so all cancers are a singular oxygen so all cancers are a singular type of disease it's just that they type of disease it's just that they type of disease it's just that they happen in different tissues but when you happen in different tissues but when you happen in different tissues but when you look at the underlying problem they're look at the underlying problem they're look at the underlying problem they're all very very similar they can't live uh all very very similar they can't live uh all very very similar they can't live uh without a fermentation which means without a fermentation which means without a fermentation which means energy without oxygen so that's the energy without oxygen so that's the energy without oxygen so that's the common pathophysiological problem in all common pathophysiological problem in all common pathophysiological problem in all cancers whether it's a colon brain cancers whether it's a colon brain cancers whether it's a colon brain breast bladder skin uh lung we we've breast bladder skin uh lung we we've breast bladder skin uh lung we we've looked at all these cancers and they're looked at all these cancers and they're looked at all these cancers and they're all they're all essentially using the all they're all essentially using the all they're all essentially using the same mechanism to to grow out of control same mechanism to to grow out of control same mechanism to to grow out of control so what is that F fermentation you so what is that F fermentation you so what is that F fermentation you mentioned fermentation is energy without mentioned fermentation is energy without mentioned fermentation is energy without oxy what does that mean uh we breathe oxy what does that mean uh we breathe oxy what does that mean uh we breathe air and we uh exhale CO2 and water vapor air and we uh exhale CO2

start in in research well understanding start in in research well understanding start in in research well it started with Oto warberg for sure uh it started with Oto warberg for sure uh it started with Oto warberg for sure uh in the 1920s uh the other linkage before in the 1920s uh the other linkage before in the 1920s uh the other linkage before I tell you what OT warberg did because I I tell you what OT warberg did because I I tell you what OT warberg did because I was like everybody else I thought cancer was like everybody else I thought cancer was like everybody else I thought cancer was a genetic disease and and I heard was a genetic disease and and I heard was a genetic disease and and I heard about warberg didn't really know what about warberg didn't really know what about warberg didn't really know what what he was talking about or invested what he was talking about or invested what he was talking about or invested any time thinking about what he said but any time thinking about what he said but any time thinking about what he said but Linda nebling was a PhD nursing student Linda nebling was a PhD nursing student Linda nebling was a PhD nursing student at Case Western Reserve University and at Case Western Reserve University and at Case Western Reserve University and in Ohio and she took these two little in Ohio and she took these two little in Ohio and she took these two little hopeless kids brain cancer we call hopeless kids brain cancer we call hopeless kids brain cancer we call hopeless cases when they have no um hopeless cases when they have no um hopeless cases when they have no um predictability of long-term survival and predictability of long-term survival and predictability of long-term survival and she gave them a ketogenic diet to lower she gave them a ketogenic diet to lower she gave them a ketogenic diet to lower blood sugar and she was able to rescue blood sugar and she was able to rescue blood sugar and she was able to rescue these kids one one one eventually died these kids one one one eventually died these kids one one one eventually died the other one was lost to followup and the other one was lost to followup and the other one was lost to followup and she said it her strategy was based on she said it her strategy was based on she said it her strategy was based on what OT warberg had said about glucose what OT warberg had said about glucose what OT warberg had said about glucose and cancer so then I said warberg I said and cancer so then I said warberg I said and cancer so then I said warberg I said who the hell what let me go back and who the hell what let me go back and who the hell what let me go back and check out who this guy was and what he check out who this guy was and what he check out who this guy was and what he did because I was seeing similar things did because I was seeing similar things did because I was seeing similar things in the in the mouse with that drug it in the in the mouse with that drug it in the in the mouse with that drug it was lowering glucose and and we were sh was lowering glucose and and we were sh was lowering glucose and and we were sh shrinking these tumor cells and we shrinking these tumor cells and we shrinking these tumor cells and we published a paper uh the first one of published a paper uh the first one of published a paper uh the first one of the first ever papers linking that how the first ever papers linking that how the first ever papers linking that how high your blood sugar is determines how high your blood sugar is determines how high your blood sugar is determines how fast your tumor will grow in the mice fast your tumor will grow in the mice fast your tumor will grow in the mice and now how this been replicated in all and now how this been replicated in all and now how this been replicated in all human cancers the higher your blood human cancers the higher your blood human cancers the higher your blood sugar the faster the tumor grows the sugar the faster the tumor grows the sugar the faster the tumor grows the lower the blood sugar the slower the lower the blood sugar the slower the lower the blood sugar the slower the tumor grows undeniable for all different tumor grows undeniable for all different tumor grows undeniable for all different human Mouse cancers wow so warberg had human Mouse cancers wow so warberg had human Mouse cancers wow so warberg had said this a long time ago back in the said this a long time ago back in the said this a long time ago back in the 1920s he he was taking slices of all 1920s he he was taking slices of all 1920s he he was taking slices of all kinds of human and rat mouse tumors and kinds of human and rat mouse tumors and kinds of human and rat mouse tumors and slicing them up and he noticed something slicing them up and he noticed something slicing them up and he noticed something really strange about these um cancers really strange about these um cancers really strange about these um cancers they take in less oxygen compared to the they take in less oxygen compared to the they take in less oxygen compared to the normal tissue from which they came wow normal tissue from which they came wow normal tissue from which they came wow so they're kind of like oxygen deprived so they're kind of like oxygen deprived so they're kind of like oxygen deprived and they were throwing out this lactic and they were throwing out this lactic and they were throwing out this lactic acid waste product that he was that he acid waste product that he was that he acid waste product that he was that he was saying and they were taking in so was saying and they were taking in so was saying and they were taking in so much more glucose than the normal so the much more glucose than the normal so the much more glucose than the normal so the normal cells take in just a little bit normal cells take in just a little bit normal cells take in just a little bit of glucose and they can make tremendous of glucose and they can make tremendous of glucose and they can make tremendous energy from a tiny amount this guy was energy from a tiny amount this guy was energy from a tiny amount this guy was taking in huge amounts of glucose but taking in huge amounts of glucose but taking in huge amounts of glucose but not fully metabolizing it to CO2 and not fully metabolizing it to CO2 and not fully metabolizing it to CO2 and water but dumping it out as lactic acid water but dumping it out as lactic acid water but dumping it out as lactic acid which is a a breakdown product of which is a a breakdown product of which is a a breakdown product of glucose that is not fully metabolized in glucose that is not fully metabolized in glucose that is not fully metabolized in the cell wow he said this is the cell wow he said this is the cell wow he said this is unbelievable and then he did all kinds unbelievable and then he did all kinds unbelievable and then he did all kinds of tissue I looked at his data was of tissue I looked at his data was of tissue I looked at his data was unbelievable he was cutting humans mice unbelievable he was cutting humans mice unbelievable he was cutting humans mice rats and seeing the same thing over and rats and seeing the same thing over and rats and seeing the same thing over and over again and uh he was saying the over again and uh he was saying the over again and uh he was saying the origin of cancer has to do with origin of cancer has to do with origin of cancer has to do with something in the ability of the something in the ability of the something in the ability of the mitochondrian the organel to generate mitochondrian the organel to generate mitochondrian the organel to generate efficient energy from oxygen so the efficient energy from oxygen so the efficient energy from oxygen so the sorry the mitochondria is the part of sorry the mitochondria is the part of sorry the mitochondria is the part of the cell that creates energy it's the the cell that creates energy it's the the cell that creates energy it's the part of the cell that creates energy part of the cell that creates energy part of the cell that creates energy through oxidative phosphorilation which through oxidative phosphorilation which through oxidative phosphorilation which is burning energy using oxygen okay okay is burning energy using oxygen okay okay is burning energy using oxygen okay okay so it's like an engine it's an engine a so it's like an engine it's an engine a so it's like an engine it's an engine a very highly efficient engine that this very highly efficient engine that this very highly efficient engine that this is an organel you have to realize we is an organel you have to realize we is an organel you have to realize we have the cell yeah and we have a nucleus have the cell yeah and we have a nucleus have the cell yeah and we have a nucleus that every everybody knows about this that every everybody knows about this that every everybody knows about this nucleus and then we have all these nucleus and then we have all these nucleus and then we have all these little organel in there we have lomes little organel in there we have lomes little organel in there we have lomes and we have the mitochondrian which is and we have the mitochondrian which is and we have the mitochondrian which is like a spaghetti Network inside the cell like a spaghetti Network inside the cell like a spaghetti Network inside the cell they fuse it's actually a second living they fuse it's actually a second living they fuse it's actually a second living it's a second living organism inside our it's a second living organism inside our it's a second living organism inside our cells and to simplify what they do the cells and to simplify what they do the cells and to simplify what they do the mitochondria they convert oxygen and mitochondria they convert oxygen and mitochondria they convert oxygen and glucose into energy yes and they combust glucose into energy yes and they combust glucose into energy yes and they combust uh energy uh they they take the foods uh energy uh they they take the foods uh energy uh they they take the foods that we eat have carbon hydrogen bonds that we eat have carbon hydrogen bonds that we eat have carbon hydrogen bonds okay and we break those down inside our okay and we break those down inside our okay and we break those down inside our mitochondria and we and we and we when mitochondria and we and we and we when mitochondria and we and we and we when we break those bonds down we create a a we break those bonds down we create a a we break those bonds down we create a a hydrogen gradient and we dissipate that hydrogen gradient and we dissipate that hydrogen gradient and we dissipate that gradient through an impeller mechanism gradient through an impeller mechanism gradient through an impeller mechanism that generates energy like crazy it's that generates energy like crazy it's that generates energy like crazy it's unbelievable very efficient highly unbelievable very efficient highly unbelievable very efficient highly efficient but the cancer cell has efficient but the cancer cell has efficient but the cancer cell has corruption in that system but it doesn't corruption in that system but it doesn't corruption in that system but it doesn't happen overnight as warberg said if you happen overnight as warberg said if you happen overnight as warberg said if you break that system too acutely and too break that system too acutely and too break that system too acutely and too fast the cell will die it doesn't have fast the cell will die it doesn't have fast the cell will die it doesn't have the so you have to have two things to the so you have to have two things to the so you have to have two things to get from oxidative phosphorilation to uh get from oxidative phosphorilation to uh get from oxidative phosphorilation to uh energy with with with minimal oxygen energy with with with minimal oxygen energy with with with minimal oxygen fermentation sorry just to keep it fermentation sorry just to keep it fermentation sorry just to keep it simple from a normal cell to a cancer simple from a normal cell to a cancer simple from a normal cell to a cancer cell from a normal cell to a cancer cell cell from a normal cell to a cancer cell cell from a normal cell to a cancer cell doesn't happen overnight okay it's a doesn't happen overnight okay it's a doesn't happen overnight okay it's a chronic damage to the ability of of that chronic damage to the ability of of that chronic damage to the ability of of that organel inside the cell to generate organel inside the cell to generate organel inside the cell to generate efficient energy okay so all we have to efficient energy okay so all we have to efficient energy okay so all we have to know with cancer is that they're how are know with cancer is that they're how are know with cancer is that they're how are they growing so rapidly why are they they growing so rapidly why are they they growing so rapidly why are they going out of control how come it's so going out of control how come it's so going out of control how come it's so hard to kill them because as long as you hard to kill them because as long as you hard to kill them because as long as you have those fermentable fuels that drive have those fermentable fuels that drive have those fermentable fuels that drive this ancient fermentation pathway um this ancient fermentation pathway um this ancient fermentation pathway um they will continue to grow they're very they will continue to grow they're very they will continue to grow they're very hard to kill and the fermenting fuels hard to kill and the fermenting fuels hard to kill and the fermenting fuels are glucose and and glutamine glutamine are glucose and and glutamine glutamine are glucose and and glutamine glutamine yeah okay so here let's let me tell you yeah okay so here let's let me tell you yeah okay so here let's let me tell you in a nut are are you ready brace in a nut are are you ready brace in a nut are are you ready brace yourself are you ready I'm ready are you yourself are you ready I'm ready are you yourself are you ready I'm ready are you braced are you braced sufficiently bra braced are you braced sufficiently bra braced are you braced sufficiently bra sufficient he's sufficiently braced okay sufficient he's sufficiently braced okay sufficient he's sufficiently braced okay so uh a solution to the cancer problem so uh a solution to the cancer problem so uh a solution to the cancer problem to manage cancer without toxicity is to to manage cancer without toxicity is to to manage cancer without toxicity is to simultaneously restrict the two fuels simultaneously restrict the two fuels simultaneously restrict the two fuels that are needed to drive this that are needed to drive this that are needed to drive this disregulated growth while transitioning disregulated growth while transitioning disregulated growth while transitioning the whole body off to a fuel that the the whole body off to a fuel that the the whole body off to a fuel that the tumor cells can't use which is fatty tumor cells can't use which is fatty tumor cells can't use which is fatty acids and Ketone bodies so when we take acids and Ketone bodies so when we take acids and Ketone bodies so when we take the cancer patients or the mice we put the cancer patients or the mice we put the cancer patients or the mice we put them into a calorie restriction lowering them into a calorie restriction lowering them into a calorie restriction lowering the blood sugar uh that I said is one the blood sugar uh that I said is one the blood sugar uh that I said is one half of the two fuels you can lower that half of the two fuels you can lower that half of the two fuels you can lower that down really really low and then we use down really really low and then we use down really really low and then we use specific drugs to Target the glutamine specific drugs to Target the glutamine specific drugs to Target the glutamine and together we can selectively restrict and together we can selectively restrict and together we can selectively restrict the two fuels while we transition the the two fuels while we transition the the two fuels while we transition the whole body over to to ketones we as a whole body over to to ketones we as a whole body over to to ketones we as a species evolved to be in nutritional species evolved to be in nutritional species evolved to be in nutritional ketosis for the the majority of our ketosis for the the majority of our ketosis for the the majority of our existence as a as a species like

years our species you and me our ancestors were always in a state of ancestors were always in a state of ancestors were always in a state of nutritional ketosis because there was nutritional ketosis because there was nutritional ketosis because there was very few carbohydrates in the very few carbohydrates in the very few carbohydrates in the environment for them to be consuming environment for them to be consuming environment for them to be consuming right so the cancer cell the body you right so the cancer cell the body you right so the cancer cell the body you and I could if we stopped eating and we and I could if we stopped eating and we and I could if we stopped eating and we took a low carbohydrate diet and just took a low carbohydrate diet and just took a low carbohydrate diet and just did water only fasting we would get into did water only fasting we would get into did water only fasting we would get into nutritional ketosis where the normal nutritional ketosis where the normal nutritional ketosis where the normal cells our brain our kidneys our heart cells our brain our kidneys our heart cells our brain our kidneys our heart can be burning these Ketone bodies can be

can't burn those fuels mitochondria they can't burn those fuels mitochondria they can't burn those fuels they're dependent on glucose and they're dependent on glucose and they're dependent on glucose and glutamine we can replace glucose and glutamine we can replace glucose and glutamine we can replace glucose and glutamine with Ketone bodies in the glutamine with Ketone bodies in the glutamine with Ketone bodies in the normal cells of our so we selectively normal cells of our so we selectively normal cells of our so we selectively marginalize these tumor cells slowly marginalize these tumor cells slowly marginalize these tumor cells slowly over time uh we they slowly start to Die over time uh we they slowly start to Die over time uh we they slowly start to Die the blood vessels disappear and the body the blood vessels disappear and the body the blood vessels disappear and the body comes in and dissolves them so for comes in and dissolves them so for comes in and dissolves them so for someone that has never heard the term someone that has never heard the term someone that has never heard the term keto before ketosis or ketones in a keto before ketosis or ketones in a keto before

believe it's not whether you believe it's what the data whether you believe it's what the data whether you believe it's what the data tell us okay so according to the somatic tell us okay so according to the somatic tell us okay so according to the somatic mutation theory of cancers mutations in mutation theory of cancers mutations in mutation theory of cancers mutations in the nucleus lead to disregulated cell the nucleus lead to disregulated cell the nucleus lead to disregulated cell growth that's the sematic mutation growth that's the sematic mutation growth that's the sematic mutation theory in the mitochondrial metabolic theory in the mitochondrial metabolic theory in the mitochondrial metabolic Theory it's a transition from oxidative Theory it's a transition from oxidative Theory it's a transition from oxidative phosphorilation to to a fermentation phosphorilation to to a fermentation phosphorilation to to a fermentation metabolism inside inside the cell um the metabolism inside inside the cell um the metabolism inside inside the cell um the mutations are largely irrelevant what do mutations are largely irrelevant what do mutations are largely irrelevant what do you mean by that when the mitochondria you mean by that when the mitochondria you mean by that when the mitochondria become defective they throw out become defective they throw out become defective they throw out Ros reactive oxygen species that are Ros reactive oxygen species that are Ros reactive oxygen species that are carcinogenic and mutogenic W what does carcinogenic and mutogenic W what does carcinogenic and mutogenic W what does that mean causing mutations so a lot of that mean causing mutations so a lot of that mean causing mutations so a lot of the mutations that we see in the nucleus the mutations that we see in the nucleus the mutations that we see in the nucleus of the tumor cell that is the subject of of the tumor cell that is the subject of of the tumor cell that is the subject of the sematic mutation Theory are the sematic mutation Theory are the sematic mutation Theory are Downstream effects of the dysfunction of Downstream effects of the dysfunction of Downstream effects of the dysfunction of the mitochondria so the mitochondria is the mitochondria so the mitochondria is the mitochondria so the mitochondria is causing a downstream effect which are causing a downstream effect which are causing a downstream effect which are mutations which according to the sematic mutations which according to the sematic mutations which according to the sematic mutation Theory are the cause of the mutation Theory are the cause of the mutation Theory are the cause of the disregulated cell growth let me tell you disregulated cell growth let me tell you disregulated cell growth let me tell you why that's absolutely why that's absolutely why that's absolutely untrue there's some cancer cells growing untrue there's some cancer cells growing untrue there's some cancer cells growing out of control have no mutations and out of control have no mutations and out of control have no mutations and normally not discuss how can that be normally not discuss how can that be normally not discuss how can that be that's a a challenge to the theory if that's a a challenge to the theory if that's a a challenge to the theory if the theory says that all cancers have the theory says that all cancers have the theory says that all cancers have mutations and you have some cancers that mutations and you have some cancers that mutations and you have some cancers that have no mutations and they're growing have no mutations and they're growing have no mutations and they're growing out of control that should say who bell out of control that should say who bell out of control that should say who bell ring one uh then they the the sematic ring one uh then they the the sematic ring one uh then they the the sematic mutation uh people people who think this mutation uh people people who think this mutation uh people people who think this said oh okay we have we have a problem said oh okay we have we have a problem said oh okay we have we have a problem here not all mutations are the ones that here not all mutations are the ones that here not all mutations are the ones that cause the disregulated only some and we cause the disregulated only some and we cause the disregulated only some and we have a name for those some that's called have a name for those some that's called have a name for those some that's called driver mut okay now it's a nice term driver mut okay now it's a nice term driver mut okay now it's a nice term because some of those mutations are because some of those mutations are because some of those mutations are called passengers they don't really do called passengers they don't really do called passengers they don't really do anything but the drivers are the ones anything but the drivers are the ones anything but the drivers are the ones that lead to the disregulated cell that lead to the disregulated cell that lead to the disregulated cell growth so we should be focusing our growth so we should be focusing our growth so we should be focusing our attention on these driver mutations new attention on these driver mutations new attention on these driver mutations new evidence from the recent scientific evidence from the recent scientific evidence from the recent scientific literature can you believe this they're literature can you believe this they're literature can you believe this they're taking tissue normal tissues from taking tissue normal tissues from taking tissue normal tissues from patients different organs and things patients different organs and things patients different organs and things like this from not patients from normal like this from not patients from normal like this from not patients from normal people no cancer perfectly like yourself people no cancer perfectly like yourself people no cancer perfectly like yourself here we would take tissue from you and here we would take tissue from you and here we would take tissue from you and say oh my Christ look at the you got say oh my Christ look at the you got say oh my Christ look at the you got driver mutation in your esophagus and driver mutation in your esophagus and driver mutation in your esophagus and your different parts of your body you your different parts of your body you your different parts of your body you got driver but you don't have a tumor got driver but you don't have a tumor got driver but you don't have a tumor what's going on with that how you what's going on with that how you what's going on with that how you explain that these driver mutations are explain that these driver mutations are explain that these driver mutations are causing disregulated cell growth when we causing disregulated cell growth when we causing disregulated cell growth when we have thousands of driver mutations that have thousands of driver mutations that have thousands of driver mutations that are there that are not causing are there that are not causing are there that are not causing disregulated cell growth oh okay that's disregulated cell growth oh okay that's disregulated cell growth oh okay that's a another problem the biggest a another problem the biggest a another problem the biggest devastating information against the devastating information against the devastating information against the somatic mutation theory is if you take somatic mutation theory is if you take somatic mutation theory is if you take the nucleus from a tumor cell cleanly the nucleus from a tumor cell cleanly the nucleus from a tumor cell cleanly take it out of the tumor cell and you take it out of the tumor cell and you take it out of the tumor cell and you have another normal cell here you take have another normal cell here you take have another normal cell here you take the nor the nucleus out of the normal the nor the nucleus out of the normal the nor the nucleus out of the normal cell and you put the tumor cell into cell and you put the tumor cell into cell and you put the tumor cell into that cytoplasm you get regulated growth that cytoplasm you get regulated growth that cytoplasm you get regulated growth no disregulated growth but if I have the no disregulated growth but if I have the no disregulated growth but if I have the normal cell and have a tumor cell take normal cell and have a tumor cell take normal cell and have a tumor cell take the tumor nucleus out of there and take the tumor nucleus out of there and take the tumor nucleus out of there and take the normal nucleus and put it into the the normal nucleus and put it into the the normal nucleus and put it into the tumor cytoplasm which contains tumor cytoplasm which contains tumor cytoplasm which contains mitochondri defective mitoch mitochondri defective mitoch mitochondri defective mitoch disregulated cell Dr this has been seen disregulated cell Dr this has been seen disregulated cell Dr this has been seen over and over and over again so just to over and over and over again so just to over and over and over again so just to summarize that so if you take the tumor summarize that so if you take the tumor summarize that so if you take the tumor nucleus side of the cell and put it into nucleus side of the cell and put it into nucleus side of the cell and put it into a a normal healthy cell yes um a a normal healthy cell yes um a a normal healthy cell yes um everything's fine everything is fine but everything's fine everything is fine but everything's fine everything is fine but if you take take healthy cell nucleus if you take take healthy cell nucleus if you take take healthy cell nucleus and put it into a tumor cell you still and put it into a tumor cell you still and put it into a tumor cell you still have the same dis regulated cell growth have the same dis regulated cell growth have the same dis regulated cell growth tumor growth so which means that it's tumor growth so which means that it's tumor growth so which means that it's not the nucleus absolutely it's not the nucleus absolutely it's not the nucleus absolutely it's something else it's something else and something else it's something else and something else it's something else and that's the mitochondria and I told you that's the mitochondria and I told you that's the mitochondria and I told you then you have cancer cells with no then you have cancer cells with no then you have cancer cells with no mutations and then you have driver mutations and then you have driver mutations and then you have driver mutations and normal cells that never mutations and normal cells that never mutations and normal cells that never become cancer you put all those things become cancer you put all those things become cancer you put all those things together and you have to be uh a

represent the approval of drugs through the Food and Drug the Food and Drug the Food and Drug Administration if you have a drug that Administration if you have a drug that Administration if you have a drug that improves a progression free survival improves a progression free survival improves a progression free survival uh progression free means it looks like uh progression free means it looks like uh progression free means it looks like the drug is working on the tumor um the drug is working on the tumor um the drug is working on the tumor um because you know the tumor you can see because you know the tumor you can see because you know the tumor you can see it it gets bigger and bigger and more it it gets bigger and bigger and more it it gets bigger and bigger and more lethal and more

progression what we call traditional progression okay it's called progression free okay it's called progression free okay it's called progression free survival and then you have overall survival and then you have overall survival and then you have overall survival so you have two ways to approve survival so you have two ways to approve survival so you have two ways to approve drugs mostly for cancer right how does drugs mostly for cancer right how does drugs mostly for cancer right how does it work on aggression free survival and it work on aggression free survival and it work on aggression free survival and how does it work on overall survival how does it work on overall survival how does it work on overall survival well they stop looking at overall well they stop looking at overall well they stop looking at overall survival now somebody's going to bark survival now somebody's going to bark survival now somebody's going to bark and say well you know bottom line is and say well you know bottom line is and say well you know bottom line is mostly progression free which means that mostly progression free which means that mostly progression free which means that the patients it looks like the tumor is the patients it looks like the tumor is the patients it looks like the tumor is being effectively managed but they live being effectively managed but they live being effectively managed but they live only a couple of months longer than they only a couple of months longer than they only a couple of months longer than they would have if they didn't use this drug would have if they didn't use this drug would have if they didn't use this drug so therefore it's approved and and and so therefore it's approved and and and so therefore it's approved and and and um that as opposed to overall survival um that as opposed to overall survival um that as opposed to overall survival you know you're only living a two okay you know you're only living a two okay you know you're only living a two okay You' lived two and a half extra months You' lived two and a half extra months You' lived two and a half extra months the tumor looked like it was manage the tumor looked like it was manage the tumor looked like it was manage pretty well but your overall survival is pretty well but your overall survival is pretty well but your overall survival is is this much but you you didn't see the is this much but you you didn't see the is this much but you you didn't see the tumor growing uh we're going to improve tumor growing uh we're going to improve tumor growing uh we're going to improve that drug so a lot of the new drugs that that drug so a lot of the new drugs that that drug so a lot of the new drugs that we're giving do a really good job at we're giving do a really good job at we're giving do a really good job at progression free survival but they do a progression free survival but they do a progression free survival but they do a horrible job in keeping people alive horrible job in keeping people alive horrible job in keeping people alive much longer which ultimately is what you much longer which ultimately is what you much longer which ultimately is what you want to do you want overall survival let want to do you want overall survival let want to do you want overall survival let me give you an example avastin uh bismid me give you an example avastin uh bismid me give you an example avastin uh bismid this this is an immoral drug that should this this is an immoral drug that should this this is an immoral drug that should never be used on people it was blocked never be used on people it was blocked never be used on people it was blocked because it caused colon perforations in because it caused colon perforations in because

metabolic therapy we we shrink the tumor down for sure we we shrink the tumor down for sure we we shrink the tumor down for sure then the surgeon can come in and he sees then the surgeon can come in and he sees then the surgeon can come in and he sees it smaller fewer blood vessels because it smaller fewer blood vessels because it smaller fewer blood vessels because of the metab therapy and we can take out of the metab therapy and we can take out of the metab therapy and we can take out a greater amount uh of of this and then a greater amount uh of of this and then a greater amount uh of of this and then we transition back to prevent this tumor we transition back to prevent this tumor we transition back to prevent this tumor from recurring metabolic therapy can be from recurring metabolic therapy can be from recurring metabolic therapy can be used to not only prevent the cancer but used to not only prevent the cancer but used to not only prevent the cancer but can also be used to treat the cancer now can also be used to treat the cancer now can also be used to treat the cancer now let me tell you go most hospitals let me tell you go most hospitals let me tell you go most hospitals suppose people say well you know I suppose people say well you know I suppose people say well you know I really want to do things to prevent really want to do things to prevent really want to do things to prevent cancer can I do standard of care before cancer can I do standard of care before cancer can I do standard of care before I have a tumor what do you mean you want I have a

cancer that's what yet when you have cancer that's what they do to you right but with metabolic they do to you right but with metabolic they do to you right but with metabolic therapy you can use it as both a therapy you can use it as both a therapy you can use it as both a prevention and a treatment it's just prevention and a treatment it's just prevention and a treatment it's just that with a treatment we bring in some that with a treatment we bring in some that with a treatment we bring in some more drugs to Target the glutamine we more drugs to Target the glutamine we more drugs to Target the glutamine we don't do that on the prevention side on don't do that on the prevention side on don't do that on the prevention side on the I was just looking at some stats as the I was just looking at some stats as the I was just looking at some stats as you were speaking around the fiveyear you were speaking around the fiveyear you were speaking around the fiveyear survival rates of a variety of different survival rates of a variety of different survival rates of a variety of different cancers um over time and it does appear cancers um over time and it does appear cancers um over time and it does appear that survival rates of these cancers that survival rates of these cancers that survival rates of these cancers from breast cancer to prostate cancer to from breast cancer to prostate cancer to from breast cancer to prostate cancer to lung cancer to leukemias um and various lung cancer to leukemias um and various lung cancer to leukemias um and various melanomas has improved since the melanomas has improved since the melanomas has improved since the 1970s so the 1970s to the 1990s to the 1970s so the 1970s to the 1990s to the 1970s so the 1970s to the 1990s to the 2010s there's been an improvement in the 2010s there's been an improvement in the 2010s there's been an improvement in the survival rate um which I guess is a survival rate um which I guess is a survival rate um which I guess is a credit to the research that's been done credit to the research that's been done credit to the research that's been done um what you're saying is that this the um what you're saying is that this the um what you're saying is that this the treatments we have still today are treatments we have still today are treatments we have still today are horrific yeah and the and the survivals horrific yeah and the and the survivals horrific yeah and the and the survivals are not that much greater it's not like are not that much greater it's not like are not that much greater it's not like you're getting massively longer you're getting massively longer you're getting massively longer survivals yeah I mean and I have to I I survivals yeah I mean and I have to I I survivals yeah I mean and I have to I I have to preface that these stats might have to preface that these stats might have to preface that these stats might not be right because this is AI we're not be right because this is AI we're not be right because this is AI we're dealing with here but the there's a 5% dealing with here but the there's a 5% dealing with here but the there's a 5% for example with breast cancer between for example with breast cancer between for example with breast cancer between the 1990s and 2010 there's just a 5% the 1990s and 2010 there's just a 5% the 1990s and 2010 there's just a 5% difference in overall survival in difference in overall survival in difference in overall survival in overall survival okay so your survival overall survival okay so your survival overall survival okay so your survival your overall survival is two and a half your overall survival is two and a half your overall survival is two and a half to three months greater I I don't to three months greater I I don't to three months greater I I don't actually have those stats in no but actually have those stats in no but actually have those stats in no but that's that's that's the the evidence that's that's that's the the evidence that's that's that's the the evidence the papers that we're looking at so so the papers that we're looking at so so the papers that we're looking at so so how do we how do we how do we prevent prevent this then I'm 32 years prevent prevent this then I'm 32 years prevent prevent this then I'm 32 years old now so I want to make sure that I old now so I want to make sure that I old now so I want to make sure that I live my life in such a way that I limit live my life in such a way that I limit live my life in such a way that I limit my chance of cancer one of the things I my chance of cancer one of the things I my chance of cancer one of the things I always reflect on is the fact that many always reflect on is the fact that many always reflect on is the fact that many of the people that I know that have got of the people that I know that have got of the people that I know that have got cancer breast cancer or other forms of cancer breast cancer or other forms of cancer breast cancer or other forms of cancer appear to be remarkably healthy cancer appear to be remarkably healthy cancer appear to be remarkably healthy yeah always at the yeah always at the yeah always at the beginning there there not always but beginning there there not always but beginning there there not always but many times the person comes in gee I many times the person comes in gee I many times the person comes in gee I just was diagnosed with cancer I didn't just was diagnosed with cancer I didn't just was diagnosed with cancer I didn't know I had

then here's should I be on a keto diet then here's should I be on a keto diet then here's what we did okay uh we developed the what we did okay uh we developed the what we did okay uh we developed the glucose Ketone index calculator at glucose Ketone index calculator at glucose Ketone index calculator at Boston College all right my students and Boston College all right my students and Boston College all right my students and I because we were trying to uh work with I because we were trying to uh work with I because we were trying to uh work with cancer patients blood sugar and ketones cancer patients blood sugar and ketones cancer patients blood sugar and ketones um independently of each other we had a um independently of each other we had a um independently of each other we had a ketone meter and we had a blood glucose ketone meter and we had a blood glucose ketone meter and we had a blood glucose meter so we were monitoring ketones by meter so we were monitoring ketones by meter so we were monitoring ketones by itself and glucose by itself and we itself and glucose by itself and we itself and glucose by itself and we worked with a very nice woman U from worked with a very nice woman U from worked with a very nice woman U from American who lived in East France who American who lived in East France who American who lived in East France who since passed away from a brain stem since passed away from a brain stem since passed away from a brain stem tumor was very very difficult we kept tumor was very very difficult we kept tumor was very very difficult we kept her alive very long but eventually we her alive very long but eventually we her alive very long but eventually we didn't know what we need what we know didn't know what we need what we know didn't know what we need what we know now but she got into an argument for a now but she got into an argument for a now but she got into an argument for a handicapped parking spot with her handicapped parking spot with her handicapped parking spot with her neighbor upstairs and her blood sug and neighbor upstairs and her blood sug and neighbor upstairs and her blood sug and blood sugar went through the roof she blood sugar went through the roof she blood sugar went through the roof she ran upstairs and she took her blood ran upstairs and she took her blood ran upstairs and she took her blood blood sugar and she says oh my God the blood sugar and she says oh my God the blood sugar and she says oh my God the tumor is going to grow I said what's tumor is going to grow I said what's tumor is going to grow I said what's your ketones and she says oh it's still your ketones and she says oh it's still your ketones and she says oh it's still 2 and a half Miller well that's still 2 and a half Miller well that's still 2 and a half Miller well that's still pretty high usually it's very very low pretty high usually it's very very low pretty high usually it's very very low it's very high so my students and I we it's very high so my students and I we it's very high so my students and I we said you know this is too traumatic to said you know this is too traumatic to said you know this is too traumatic to try to measure these two independently try to measure these two independently try to measure these two independently why don't we make a singular number why don't we make a singular number why don't we make a singular number divide the glucose in molar in the blood divide the glucose in molar in the blood divide the glucose in molar in the blood by the Ketone and Molar in the blood now by the Ketone and Molar in the blood now by the Ketone and Molar in the blood now you get this number that's much more you get this number that's much more you get this number that's much more stable and it allows the cancer patient stable and it allows the cancer patient stable and it allows the cancer patient to know that if I keep this Zone in 2.0 to know that if I keep this Zone in 2.0 to know that if I keep this Zone in 2.0 and below my tumor cells aren't going to and below my tumor cells aren't going to and below my tumor cells aren't going to be able to grow very fast I did this for be able to grow very fast I did this for be able to grow very fast I did this for the brain cancer right now it's being the brain cancer right now it's being the brain cancer right now it's

a study on dogs a dog that so you did a study on dogs a dog that so you did a study on dogs a dog with a tumor yes can you tell me about with a tumor yes can you tell me about with a tumor yes can you tell me about that study it was a woman came to me and that study it was a woman came to me and that study it was a woman came to me and this is what I say does you don't have this is what I say does you don't have this is what I say does you don't have to have a a PhD in Biochemistry to to have a a PhD in Biochemistry to to have a a PhD in Biochemistry to understand what some of the things this understand what some of the things this understand what some of the things this woman had no degree whatsoever she just woman had no degree whatsoever she just woman had no degree whatsoever she just heard the uh about what we did to these heard the uh about what we did to these heard the uh about what we did to these mice and she did the same thing to her mice and she did the same thing to her mice and she did the same thing to her dog um it was a pitbull and at aged dog um it was a pitbull and at aged dog um it was a pitbull and at aged seven years old it had big mast cell seven years old it had big mast cell seven years old it had big mast cell tumor on its lip so she listened to my tumor on its lip so she listened to my tumor on its lip so she listened to my YouTube video over and over she said to YouTube video over and over she said to YouTube video over and over she said to me I just kept listening then he says I me I just kept listening then he says I me I just kept listening then he says I I got I I I I got some raw chicken she I got I I I I got some raw chicken she I got I I I I got some raw chicken she says dogs wolves evolved to eat chickens says dogs wolves evolved to eat chickens says dogs wolves evolved to eat chickens so she got some uh chicken Cho chopped so she got some uh chicken Cho chopped so she got some uh chicken Cho chopped up the chicken she cut the calories of up the chicken she cut the calories of up the chicken she cut the calories of she found some dog food calculator to she found some dog food calculator to she found some dog food calculator to how much calories the dog was getting how much calories the dog was getting how much calories the dog was getting she cut the calories the dog look lost she cut the calories the dog look lost she cut the calories the dog look lost only 5% of its body weight only 5% of its body weight only 5% of its body weight she got uh pollic fish oil raw eggs and she got uh pollic fish oil raw eggs and she got uh pollic fish oil raw eggs and cut all the calories everything was all cut all the calories everything was all cut all the calories everything was all natural for this dog um and all of a natural for this dog um and all of a natural for this dog um and all of a sudden we have the pictures you can see sudden we have the pictures you can see sudden we have the pictures you can see them in the P if you saw the picture big them in the P if you saw the picture big them in the P if you saw the picture big big tumor on its lip that the the big tumor on its lip that the the big tumor on its lip that the the veterinarians said this dog is gonna to veterinarians said this dog is gonna to veterinarians said this dog is gonna to survive you have to give him chemo and survive you have to give him chemo and survive you have to give him chemo and radiation and surgery and all this kind radiation and surgery and all this kind radiation and surgery and all this kind of stuff and it's going to cost a lot of of stuff and it's going to cost a lot of of stuff and it's going to cost a lot of money the dog's gonna have diarrhea it's money the dog's gonna have diarrhea it's money the dog's gonna have diarrhea it's going to be you know she didn't want any going to be you know she didn't want any going to be you know she didn't want any part of that so she said well let's just part of that so she said well let's just part of that so she said well let's just try this metabolic thing and and she try this metabolic thing and and she try this metabolic thing and and she kept all the records and the pictures kept all the records and the pictures kept all the records and the pictures and what she did and how much she gave and what she did and how much she gave and what she did and how much she gave the dog and all this so I was able to the dog and all this so I was able to the dog and all this so I was able to get all that information from her um put get all that information from her um put get all that information from her um put my friend Lauren Lauren Nations who was my friend Lauren Lauren Nations who was my friend Lauren Lauren Nations who was a veterinarian uh on the paper because I a veterinarian uh on the paper because I a veterinarian uh on the paper because I said what biology guy at Boston College said what biology guy at Boston College said what biology guy at Boston College is telling you how to manage cancer in a is telling you how to manage cancer in a is telling you how to manage cancer in a dog we got to have some veterinarian on dog we got to have some veterinarian on dog we got to have some veterinarian on here to validate to make sure he's there here to validate to make sure he's there here to validate to make sure he's there and he looked at the pictures and we and he looked at the pictures and we and he looked at the pictures and we looked at all the thing and disappeared looked at all the thing and disappeared looked at all the thing and disappeared so what happened was the dog eventually so what happened was the dog eventually so what happened was the dog eventually died of heart disease at 15 and a 12 died of heart disease at 15 and a 12 died of heart disease at 15 and a 12 years years of age so essentially that's years years of age so essentially that's years years of age so essentially that's the only when people say well metabolic the only when people say well metabolic the only when people say well metabolic therapy cure cancer I I say metabolic therapy cure cancer I I say metabolic therapy cure cancer I I say metabolic therapy is never considered a cure for therapy is never considered a cure for therapy is never considered a cure for cancer it's an effective non-toxic cancer it's an effective non-toxic cancer it's an effective non-toxic management for cancer but in the case of management for cancer but in the case of management for cancer but in the case of that dog it appeared to work to cure the that dog it appeared to work to cure the that dog it appeared to work to cure the dog but that's the only one I'll say oh dog but that's the only one I'll say oh dog but that's the only one I'll say oh he's gonna say cure cannot that dog he's gonna say cure cannot that dog he's gonna say cure cannot that dog happened to get he died from old age happened to get he died from old age happened to get he died from old age from a heart heart attack and we did it from a heart heart attack and we did it from a heart heart attack and we did it with a brain tumor guy Pablo Kelly who with a brain tumor guy Pablo Kelly who with a brain tumor guy Pablo Kelly who just passed away unfortunately from a just passed away unfortunately from a just passed away unfortunately from a from a surgical um his his uh had a a from a surgical um his his uh had a a from a surgical um his his uh had a a major cerebral uh Hemorrhage after his major cerebral uh Hemorrhage after his major cerebral uh Hemorrhage after his surgery from Devon England you know surgery from Devon England you know surgery from Devon England you know Devon England that's where I'm from are Devon England that's where I'm from are Devon England that's where I'm from are you from Devon yeah oh wow well Pablo you from Devon yeah oh wow well Pablo you from Devon yeah oh wow well Pablo was there he just passed away was

Pablo Pablo Kelly before he passed away Pablo Pablo Kelly before he passed away Pablo Pablo Kelly so he was from Devon England had a gleo so he was from Devon England had a gleo so he was from Devon England had a gleo blastoma which is the worst of the worst blastoma which is the worst of the worst blastoma which is the worst of the worst uh they said and he's all over your your uh they said and he's all over your your uh they said and he's all over your your newspapers there and Devon he was always newspapers there and Devon he was always newspapers there and Devon he was always sending me articles from England um man sending me articles from England um man sending me articles from England um man rejects standard of care so he he had rejects standard of care so he he had rejects standard of care so he he had this gleo blastoma and they took the this gleo blastoma and they took the this gleo blastoma and they took the tissue out which is brain cancer yeah tissue out which is brain cancer yeah tissue out which is brain cancer yeah brain the worst of the brain cancers you brain the worst of the brain cancers you brain the worst of the brain cancers you know uh they took the tumor out and they know uh they took the tumor out and they know uh they took the tumor out and they said oh you it's in inoperable said oh you it's in inoperable said oh you it's in inoperable inoperable and uh but if you do inoperable and uh but if you do inoperable and uh but if you do radiation in chemo uh we you might live radiation in chemo uh we you might live radiation in chemo uh we you might live nine maybe 12 months at the most well nine maybe 12 months at the most well nine maybe 12 months at the most well Pablo came from a family of like we Pablo came from a family of like we Pablo came from a family of like we don't dabble and and this kind of don't dabble and and this kind of don't dabble and and this kind of medicine we're more holistic kind of medicine we're more holistic kind of medicine we're more holistic kind of people so he emailed me this was in 2014 people so he emailed me this was in 2014 people so he emailed me this was in 2014 um and said I want to try this metabolic um and said I want to try this metabolic um and said I want to try this metabolic thing so he rejected uh chemo and thing so he rejected uh chemo and thing so he rejected uh chemo and radiation and they said it wasn't radiation and they said it wasn't radiation and they said it wasn't surgically capable of being completely surgically capable of being completely surgically capable of being completely removed anyway so he did this I I gave removed anyway so he did this I I gave removed anyway so he did this I I gave him the information that I give to him the information that I give to him the information that I give to everybody and this was way back before everybody and this was way back before everybody and this was way back before we knew a lot of what we now know and uh we knew a lot of what we now know and uh we knew a lot of what we now know and uh I said this poor guy he sees another one I said this poor guy he sees another one I said this poor guy he sees another one and they said you're going to be dead and they said you're going to be dead and they said you're going to be dead they they brow beat him they try to they they brow beat him they try to they they brow beat him they try to force him to put the radiation mask on force him to put the radiation mask on force him to put the radiation mask on they hacked his beard off uh all this they hacked his beard off uh all this they hacked his beard off uh all this kind of stuff and he just jumped up he kind of stuff and he just jumped up he kind of stuff and he just jumped up he said I can't do this stuff so um he said I can't do this stuff so um he said I can't do this stuff so um he didn't take any steroids he didn't take didn't take any steroids he didn't take didn't take any steroids he didn't take any any radiation he didn't take any any any radiation he didn't take any any any radiation he didn't take any chemo he just did the metabolic therapy chemo he just did the metabolic

that going on with that so so he calls me up and he says you so so he calls me up and he says you so so he calls me up and he says you know um I went in for a CAT scan the know um I went in for a CAT scan the know um I went in for a CAT scan the other day doctors are like still other day doctors are like still other day doctors are like still surprised that he's alive and they said surprised that he's alive and they said surprised that he's alive and they said this tumor is is still there and it's this tumor is is still there and it's this tumor is is still there and it's growing and they think they can cut it growing and they think they can cut it growing and they think they can cut it out now so he was three years on on just out now so he was three years on on just out now so he was three years on on just metabolic approach he didn't take any metabolic approach he didn't take any metabolic approach he didn't take any glutamine Inhibitors which was really glutamine Inhibitors which was really glutamine Inhibitors which was really remarkable so so anyway he asked me and remarkable so so anyway he asked me and remarkable so so anyway he asked me and I have I have physician friends that a I have I have physician friends that a I have I have physician friends that a radiologist that can look at it and we radiologist that can look at it and we radiologist that can look at it and we measured it when it was first first measured it when it was first first measured it when it was first first diagnosed in 2014 and then we saw it did diagnosed in 2014 and then we saw it did diagnosed in 2014 and then we saw it did become a little bigger so and the now become a little bigger so and the now become a little bigger so and the now the surgeon said I think I can get it the surgeon said I think I can get it the surgeon said I think I can get it looks more more receptable here it was looks more more receptable here it was looks more more receptable here it was inoperable now it becomes receptable so inoperable now it becomes receptable so inoperable now it becomes receptable so he took it out and um Pablo recovered he took it out and um Pablo recovered he took it out and um Pablo recovered really well and uh the surgeon says I really well and uh the surgeon says I really well and uh the surgeon says I think I got it all wow so so and and think I got it all wow so so and and think I got it all wow so so and and Pablo is measuring his glucose Ketone Pablo is measuring his glucose Ketone Pablo is measuring his glucose Ketone index with our Keo monitor so I had index with our Keo monitor so I had index with our Keo monitor so I had every day sometimes two and three five every day sometimes two and three five every day sometimes two and three five years of data on Pablo can you believe years of data on Pablo can you believe years of data on Pablo can you believe this so so anyway Pablo thinks he's this so so anyway Pablo thinks he's this so so anyway Pablo thinks he's cured because the the surgeon all of a cured because the the surgeon all of a cured because the the surgeon all of a sudden he goes back to his kind of weak sudden he goes back to his kind of weak sudden he goes back to his kind of weak weak ways and you can see the his gki weak ways and you can see the his gki weak ways and you can see the his gki goes up and all of a sudden the tumor goes up and all of a sudden the tumor goes up and all of a sudden the tumor starts to show up again puts the fear of starts to show up again puts the fear of starts to show up again puts the fear of God back into him goes back on a more God back into him goes back on a more God back into him goes back on a more restrict condition another three years restrict condition another three years restrict condition another three years goes by and this time the tumor is goes by and this time the tumor is goes by and this time the tumor is growing slowly very slow don't forget growing slowly very slow don't forget growing slowly very slow don't forget gleo blastomas kill you very quickly um gleo blastomas kill you very quickly um gleo blastomas kill you very quickly um with standard of

three and he's good so anyway now he's three and he's got six years out and he says you know got six years out and he says you know got six years out and he says you know um uh it's still back you know he I got um uh it's still back you know he I got um uh it's still back you know he I got to go in so it first so this is second to go in so it first so this is second to go in so it first so this is second debul first debul goes off gets back on debul first debul goes off gets back on debul first debul goes off gets back on another second debulking another three another second debulking another three another second debulking another three years goes by he has a third debulking years goes by he has a third debulking years goes by he has a third debulking can you believe this the debulking can you believe this the debulking can you believe this the debulking debulking is the cutting the tumor out debulking is the cutting the tumor out debulking is the cutting the tumor out it's the removal surgical removal of it's the removal surgical removal of it's the removal surgical removal of this tumor but he's never had radiation this tumor but he's never had radiation this tumor but he's never had radiation or chemo or any of the kinds of stamp or chemo or any of the kinds of stamp or chemo or any of the kinds of stamp what we call standards of care so for what we call standards of care so for what we call standards of care so for and now um he he has uh I talked to him and now um he he has uh I talked to him and now um he he has uh I talked to him a couple of weeks ago and uh he was a couple of weeks ago and uh he was a couple of weeks ago and uh he was doing he was doing really really good he doing he was doing really really good he doing he was doing really really good he had the the third removal and we were had the the third removal and we were had the the third removal and we were laughing with myself and Dr duer and my laughing with myself and Dr duer and my laughing with myself and Dr duer and my associates he says yeah can you imagine associates he says yeah can you imagine associates he says yeah can you imagine um uh I've had now three operations on a um uh I've had now three operations on a um uh I've had now three operations on a previously inoperable tumor so we were saying wow they got tumor so we were saying wow they got tumor so we were saying wow they got that wrong didn't they follow and they that wrong didn't they follow and they that wrong didn't they follow and they kept wanting to irradiate him and do all kept wanting to irradiate him and do all kept wanting to irradiate him and do all this stuff and he said no no going to this stuff and he said no no going to this stuff and he said no no going to keep doing this and so we were speaking keep doing this and so we were speaking keep doing this and so we were speaking to him and and uh he's out 10 years the to him and and uh he's out 10 years the to him and and uh he's out 10 years the tumor was was diagnosed in in in August tumor was was diagnosed in in in August tumor was was diagnosed in in in August 2014 and he passed away August uh 2014 and he passed away August uh 2014 and he passed away August uh 2024 from they try to go in and get the 2024 from they try to go in and get the 2024 from they try to go in and get the last bit of tumor out of his brain he last bit of tumor out of his brain he last bit of tumor out of his brain he came out of we got him uh we talked to came out of we got him uh we talked to came out of we got him uh we talked to him a thumbs up smiling talking like him a thumbs up smiling talking like him a thumbs up smiling talking like crazy six hours later cereal hemr and crazy six hours later cereal hemr and crazy six hours later cereal hemr and need dies so uh he didn't die from the need dies so uh he didn't die from the need dies so uh he didn't die from the cancer he died from the a surgical cancer he died from the a surgical cancer he died from the a surgical problem with the surgery so he was a you problem with the surgery so he was a you problem with the surgery so he was a you talk about long-term survivors uh you talk about long-term survivors uh you talk about long-term survivors uh you rarely survive two years with a gleo rarely survive two years with a gleo rarely survive two years with a gleo blastoma the fact that he was out 10 blastoma the fact that he was out 10 blastoma the fact that he was out 10 years and if he hadn't had that last bit years and if he hadn't had that last bit years and if he hadn't had that last bit of surgery the guy would have still been of surgery the guy would have still been of surgery the guy would have still been alive because he was talking like you alive because he was talking like you alive because he was talking like you and I are talking this is a guy who has and I are talking this is a guy who has and I are talking this is a guy who has a a terminal so I said to Pablo I said a a terminal so I said to Pablo I said a a terminal so I said to Pablo I said you could outlive me I I says I said you could outlive me I I says I said you could outlive me I I says I said we're all terminal to some extent right we're all terminal to some extent right we're all terminal to some extent right we're never all of us aren't going to we're never all of us aren't going to we're never all of us aren't going to live to I said sure he was a young guy live to I said sure he was a young guy live to I said sure he was a young guy he was only 20 22 or 23 when he was he was only 20 22 or 23 when he was he was only 20 22 or 23 when he was diagnosed he was in his 30s now when he diagnosed he was in his 30s now when he diagnosed he was in his 30s now when he passed away 10 years so he's 33 34 years passed away 10 years so he's 33 34 years passed away 10 years so he's 33 34 years old and and I said you know I could be old and and I said you know I could be old and and I said you know I could be dead before you and we were laughing and dead before you and we were laughing and dead before you and we were laughing and we had a good time and then next thing I we had a good time and then next thing I we had a good time and then next thing I know I got an email from his wife he know I got an email from his wife he know I got an email from his wife he said Pablo is is on on on said Pablo is is on on on said Pablo is is on on on on brain dead and something I said what on brain dead and something I said what on brain dead and something I said what the hell happened what happened to this the hell happened what happened to this the hell happened what happened to this poor guy and it wasn't the cancer so um poor guy and it

debulking the longer the patient will debulking the longer the patient will survive the evidence is massive to survive the evidence is massive to survive the evidence is massive to support that but you know with a lot of support that but you know with a lot of support that but you know with a lot of these brain tumors you don't get it all these brain tumors you don't get it all these brain tumors you don't get it all and there's always some little piece and there's always some little piece and there's always some little piece that remains and when you irradiate you that remains and when you irradiate you that remains and when you irradiate you explode the ability to the cells to explode the ability to the cells to explode the ability to the cells to ferment energy and it's very hard to ferment energy and it's very hard to ferment energy and it's very hard to kill them but but if you can get the kill them but but if you can get the kill them but but if you can get the majority of it out and then transition majority of it out and then transition majority of it out and then transition the patient back into a metabolic State the patient back into a metabolic State the patient back into a metabolic State keeping the pressure on those tumor keeping the pressure on those tumor keeping the pressure on those tumor cells you can remain healthy like Pablo cells you can remain healthy like Pablo cells you can remain healthy like Pablo I mean these these guys can and when you I mean these these guys can and when you I mean these these guys can and when you found in mice is that when ketogenic found in mice is that when ketogenic found in mice is that when ketogenic diet was combined with a hyperbaric diet was combined with a hyperbaric diet was combined with a hyperbaric oxygen therapy the average survival time oxygen therapy the average survival time oxygen therapy the average survival time was increased by roughly 80% yeah even was increased by roughly 80% yeah even was increased by roughly 80% yeah even more sometimes now but what okay so why more sometimes now but what okay so why more sometimes now but what okay so why do we hyper do hyperbaric oxygen right do we hyper do hyperbaric oxygen right do we hyper do hyperbaric oxygen right that's the question what's going on with that's the question what's going on with that's the question what's going on with hyperbaric oxygen why is this like a hyperbaric oxygen why is this like a hyperbaric oxygen why is this like a good thing it works best when the good thing it works best when the good thing it works best when the patient and the mouse is in nutritional patient and the mouse is in nutritional patient and the mouse is in nutritional ketosis okay so look we have a tumor we ketosis okay so look we have a tumor we ketosis okay so look we have a tumor we iriate that tumor how does the radiation iriate that tumor how does the radiation iriate that tumor how does the radiation kill the tumor cells it hits oxygen kill the tumor cells it hits oxygen kill the tumor cells it hits oxygen blows up and it causes a reactive R and blows up and it causes a reactive R and blows up and it causes a reactive R and it's like a a stepping on a landmine it it's like a a stepping on a landmine it it's like a a stepping on a landmine it blows the tumor up right so um cancer blows the tumor up right so um cancer blows the tumor up right so um cancer cells protect themselves even though cells protect themselves even though cells protect themselves even though they make a lot of rust they all they're they make a lot of rust they all they're they make a lot of rust they all they're this close to death anyway but they have this close to death anyway but they have this close to death anyway but they have a very powerful antioxidant system and a very powerful antioxidant system and a very powerful antioxidant system and interestingly enough that besides interestingly enough that besides interestingly enough that besides causing the disregulated growth the causing the disregulated growth the causing the disregulated growth the glucose and the glutamine also protect glucose and the glutamine also protect glucose and the glutamine also protect them to some extent from the Ross that them to some extent from the Ross that them to some extent from the Ross that they're making and can you believe this they're making and can you believe this they're making and can you believe this the Ross r r reactive oxygen species the Ross r r reactive oxygen species the Ross r r reactive

they're they destroy our our our proteins lipids and and nucleic acids proteins lipids and and nucleic acids proteins lipids and and nucleic acids they're disruptive molecules so they're disruptive molecules so they're disruptive molecules so radiation will cause a Ross in the micro radiation will cause a Ross in the micro radiation will cause a Ross in the micro environment Ros that'll blow up and kill environment Ros that'll blow up and kill environment Ros that'll blow up and kill cells normal and and tumor cells but but cells normal and and tumor cells but but cells normal and and tumor cells but but if you want to selectively kill tumor if you want to selectively kill tumor if you want to selectively kill tumor cells you with Ross Not to cause your cells you with Ross Not to cause your cells you with Ross Not to cause your hair to fall out your gums to bleed and hair to fall out your gums to bleed and hair to fall out your gums to bleed and all this crazy stuff you take the all this crazy stuff you take the all this crazy stuff you take the patient you put him in nutritional patient you put him in nutritional patient you put him in nutritional ketosis and you say he's l a low gki ketosis and you say he's l a low gki ketosis and you say he's l a low gki then you go into hyperbaric oxygen which then you go into hyperbaric oxygen which then you go into hyperbaric oxygen which dissolves oxygen directly into your dissolves oxygen directly into your dissolves oxygen directly into your blood now it's better than just blood now it's better than just blood now it's better than just breathing 100% oxygen because you can breathing 100% oxygen because you can breathing 100% oxygen because you can actually dissolve oxygen in the actually dissolve oxygen in the actually dissolve oxygen in the bloodstream then you're taking away the bloodstream then you're taking away the bloodstream then you're taking away the two fuels that protect the tumor and two fuels that protect the tumor and two fuels that protect the tumor and you're giving it internal Ross which you're giving it internal Ross which you're giving it internal Ross which kills the tumor internally only to the kills the tumor internally only to the kills the tumor internally only to the tumor cell not to your surrounding tumor cell not to your surrounding tumor cell not to your surrounding tissues so you're killing selectively tissues so you're killing selectively tissues so you're killing selectively killing tumor cells without collateral killing tumor cells without collateral killing

# Removed Claims - Not Diet/Keto Related
**Reason for Removal**: These claims are not directly related to diet, ketogenic approaches, or dietary prevention/treatment of cancer.

## Cancer Statistics & Epidemiology (Removed)

**R1.** Cancer incidence: Almost 2 million new cases diagnosed per year in the United States
- *Reason*: General statistic, not diet-related

**R2.** Cancer deaths: 1,700 people die per day from cancer in the United States (about 70 people per hour)
- *Reason*: General statistic, not diet-related

**R3.** Annual cancer deaths: 612,000 people will die from cancer in 2024 in the US
- *Reason*: General statistic, not diet-related

**R4.** China cancer deaths: 8,000 people per day die from cancer in China
- *Reason*: General statistic, not diet-related

**R5.** Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide (after heart disease)
- *Reason*: General statistic, not diet-related

**R6.** Global cancer incidence projected to be "a lot worse by 2050"
- *Reason*: General projection, not diet-related

**R7.** Lung cancer is the number one cancer for both men and women
- *Reason*: General statistic, not diet-related

**R8.** Early onset cancer (under age 50) increased by roughly 80% between 1990 and 2019
- *Reason*: General trend, not specifically diet-related

**R9.** Anti-smoking campaigns in the 1990s reduced cancer deaths by 30-32%
- *Reason*: Smoking intervention, not diet-related

## Genetic Theory Claims (Removed)

**R10.** Some cancer cells grow out of control with no genetic mutations
- *Reason*: Genetic theory debate, not dietary intervention

**R11.** Normal tissue from healthy people contains "driver mutations" without causing cancer
- *Reason*: Genetic theory, not diet-related

**R12.** Nuclear transfer experiments: Tumor nucleus in normal cell cytoplasm = normal growth
- *Reason*: Cell biology research, not dietary intervention

**R13.** Nuclear transfer experiments: Normal nucleus in tumor cell cytoplasm = continued tumor growth
- *Reason*: Cell biology research, not dietary intervention

## Environmental/Chemical Carcinogens (Removed)

**R14.** Talcum powder causes ovarian cancer by forming foci in urogenital tract
- *Reason*: Chemical carcinogen, not diet-related

**R15.** Microplastics may cause cancer by forming small foci in cell populations
- *Reason*: Environmental toxin, not diet-related

**R16.** Chemical carcinogens include: asbestos, tetrahydrochloride, arsenics, urethane
- *Reason*: Industrial chemicals, not food-related

## Healthcare System Claims (Removed)

**R17.** National Cancer Institute awards $7 billion per year for cancer research
- *Reason*: Healthcare funding, not diet-related

**R18.** Most cancer drug approvals now focus on "progression free survival" rather than "overall survival"
- *Reason*: Drug approval process, not diet-related

**R19.** Avastin causes tumors to "permeate entire brain" while appearing to shrink on scans
- *Reason*: Drug side effects, not diet-related

**R20.** Five-year survival for glioblastoma is "very very low," 10-year survival "almost zero"
- *Reason*: Disease prognosis, not diet-related

## Historical/Biographical Claims (Removed)

**R21.** Angus Barberi fasted for 377 days without food
- *Reason*: While fasting-related, this is a biographical claim rather than therapeutic research

**R22.** George Cahill fasted obese people for 250-300 days safely
- *Reason*: Historical medical practice, not cancer-specific

**R23.** Jesus fasted for 40 days in the desert
- *Reason*: Religious reference, not scientific/medical claim

## Cell Biology Details (Removed)

**R24.** Cancer cells can survive in cyanide (which kills normal cells)
- *Reason*: Cell biology detail, not dietary intervention

**R25.** Cancer cells throw out lactic acid and succinic acid even in the presence of oxygen
- *Reason*: Cell biology mechanism, not dietary claim

**R26.** The mitochondria in cancer cells are defective and inefficient
- *Reason*: Cell biology detail, not dietary intervention

## Summary of Removals

**Total Removed Claims: 26**

**Categories Removed:**
- General cancer statistics (9 claims)
- Genetic theory debates (4 claims)
- Environmental carcinogens (3 claims)
- Healthcare system issues (4 claims)
- Historical/biographical references (3 claims)
- Cell biology mechanisms (3 claims)

**Rationale**: These claims, while potentially interesting, don't directly relate to dietary interventions, ketogenic approaches, or nutritional prevention/treatment strategies for cancer. The research focus should be on actionable dietary claims that can inform prevention and treatment decisions.

**Retained Focus**: 26 claims specifically about ketogenic diets, metabolic therapy, fasting, calorie restriction, and food-based interventions for cancer prevention and treatment.

## 🔬 Research Standards

### Evidence Quality Scale
- **🥇 High**: Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, large RCTs
- **🥈 Moderate**: Individual RCTs, well-designed cohort studies  
- **🥉 Limited**: Case-control studies, animal studies, mechanistic studies
- **⚠️ Very Limited**: Case reports, in vitro studies, expert opinion

### Assessment Categories
- **✅ SUPPORTED**: Strong evidence supports the claim
- **⚖️ PARTIALLY SUPPORTED**: Some evidence supports, with important caveats
- **❌ NOT SUPPORTED**: Evidence contradicts or doesn't support the claim
- **❓ INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE**: Not enough quality evidence to determine

## 🎯 Key Findings So Far

### Emerging Themes
1. **Metabolic Complexity**: Cancer metabolism shows significant heterogeneity
2. **Universal Claims Problematic**: Statements using "ALL cancers" often oversimplified
3. **Strong Epidemiological Evidence**: Glucose-cancer associations well-documented
4. **Clinical Translation Challenges**: Gap between mechanistic insights and therapy

### Research Quality
- Mix of high-quality epidemiological studies and mechanistic research
- Need to distinguish Dr. Seyfried's interpretations from broader consensus
- Important to balance mechanistic insights with clinical evidence

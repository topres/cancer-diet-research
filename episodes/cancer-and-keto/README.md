## 🎓 Research Standards

### Source Review Methodology
Each completed claim includes a comprehensive **Sources Review** table evaluating:

- **Study Type** (RCT, cohort, meta-analysis, etc.)
- **Sample/Population** (size and characteristics)
- **Quality Assessment** (High/Moderate/Low based on methodology)
- **Relevance** to specific claim (High/Moderate/Low)
- **Key Findings** (relevant to the claim)
- **Limitations** (methodological constraints)
- **Support Classification** (Supports/Mixed/Contradicts/Inconclusive)

### Evidence Quality Scale
- 🥇 **High**: Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, large RCTs
- 🥈 **Moderate**: Individual RCTs, well-designed cohort studies  
- 🥉 **Limited**: Case-control, animal studies, mechanistic studies
- ⚠️ **Very Limited**: Case reports, in vitro studies

### Neutral Evaluation Approach
- Evidence-based assessment without bias toward medical consensus
- Focus on methodology quality over journal prestige
- Peer-reviewed literature only
- Transparent limitation acknowledgment

## 📚 Key Findings Summary

### Strong Evidence Support
- **Warburg Effect**: Well-established phenomenon in majority of cancers
- **Glucose-Cancer Correlation**: Extensive epidemiological evidence
- **Blood Sugar Impact**: Multiple large cohort studies confirm association

### Complex/Mixed Evidence  
- **Ketone Utilization**: Significant heterogeneity across cancer types
- **Mitochondrial Function**: Not universally defective in cancer
- **Universal Claims**: "ALL cancers" statements often oversimplified

### Research Gaps Identified
- Limited human clinical trials for ketogenic interventions
- Need for biomarker-driven patient selection
- Mechanistic understanding vs. clinical translation gap

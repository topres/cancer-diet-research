## Diet/Keto/Prevention/Treatment Claims

### **Cancer Metabolism & Diet**

**1.** All cancers depend on fermentation energy (without oxygen) and require glucose and glutamine as fuels
- *Context*: Core metabolic theory claim
- *Research Focus*: Warburg effect and cancer cell metabolism

**2.** Higher blood sugar directly correlates with faster tumor growth; lower blood sugar correlates with slower tumor growth
- *Context*: Direct dietary intervention claim
- *Research Focus*: Glycemic control and tumor progression

**3.** Cancer cells cannot effectively burn ketones due to defective mitochondria, while normal cells can
- *Context*: Ketogenic diet therapeutic rationale
- *Research Focus*: Ketone metabolism in cancer vs normal cells

**4.** Ketones are "super fuel" - more energy efficient than glucose or fatty acids for healthy cells
- *Context*: Metabolic advantage claim
- *Research Focus*: Ketone body energy efficiency

### **Ketogenic Diet & Cancer Treatment**

**5.** Ketogenic diet can be used as both prevention and treatment for cancer by restricting glucose/glutamine while providing ketones
- *Context*: Primary therapeutic claim
- *Research Focus*: Clinical trials of ketogenic interventions

**6.** Metabolic therapy (ketogenic approach) allows cancer patients to "outlive their predictabilities"
- *Context*: Survival benefit claim
- *Research Focus*: Ketogenic diet survival outcomes

**7.** Chemotherapy at lower doses is more effective when patients are in nutritional ketosis
- *Context*: Synergistic treatment claim
- *Research Focus*: Keto + chemotherapy combination studies

**8.** Hyperbaric oxygen therapy combined with ketogenic diet increased mouse survival by ~80%
- *Context*: Combination therapy claim
- *Research Focus*: Hyperbaric oxygen + ketogenic studies

### **Historical Diet & Cancer**

**9.** Cancer was extremely rare in traditional populations (African tribes, Arctic populations, Aboriginal peoples) living on ancestral diets
- *Context*: Traditional diet protection claim
- *Research Focus*: Epidemiological studies of traditional diets

**10.** When modern processed diets entered traditional societies, cancer rates went "out of control"
- *Context*: Dietary transition and cancer rates
- *Research Focus*: Nutrition transition studies

**11.** Wild animals (wolves, chimpanzees, monkeys) don't get cancer on natural diets, but domestic animals do
- *Context*: Natural diet vs processed food
- *Research Focus*: Comparative oncology studies

### **Human Evolution & Ketosis**

**12.** Humans evolved to be in nutritional ketosis for most of our existence (1.5 million years) due to low carbohydrate availability
- *Context*: Evolutionary basis for ketogenic diet
- *Research Focus*: Paleolithic nutrition research

**13.** Our ancestors had no cancer and no obesity while living in natural ketosis
- *Context*: Ancestral health claim
- *Research Focus*: Paleopathology and ancient health

### **Calorie Restriction & Cancer**

**14.** Calorie restriction in mice makes it "hard to get them to get tumors"
- *Context*: Caloric restriction as prevention
- *Research Focus*: CR and cancer incidence studies

**15.** Mice on calorie restriction had dramatically reduced breast cancer incidence
- *Context*: Specific cancer prevention claim
- *Research Focus*: CR and mammary tumor studies

**16.** Exercise prevents cancer by lowering blood sugar and glutamine while promoting ketosis
- *Context*: Exercise as metabolic intervention
- *Research Focus*: Exercise, metabolism, and cancer prevention

### **Fasting & Cancer**

**17.** Water-only fasting can put the body into therapeutic ketosis for cancer management
- *Context*: Fasting as metabolic therapy
- *Research Focus*: Fasting and cancer outcomes

**18.** Intermittent fasting and prolonged fasting can prevent and treat cancer
- *Context*: Various fasting protocols
- *Research Focus*: Fasting mimicking diets and cancer

### **Specific Dietary Components**

**19.** Processed carbohydrates directly promote cancer growth by feeding fermentation pathways
- *Context*: Specific food category harm
- *Research Focus*: Refined carbohydrates and cancer risk

**20.** Low glycemic index foods help maintain low glucose-ketone index (GKI) for cancer prevention
- *Context*: Food selection criteria
- *Research Focus*: Glycemic index and cancer outcomes

**21.** Mediterranean-style diets that are low in carbohydrates can prevent cancer
- *Context*: Specific diet pattern recommendation
- *Research Focus*: Mediterranean diet and cancer prevention

### **Glucose-Ketone Index (GKI)**

**22.** Maintaining a glucose-ketone index of 2.0 or below prevents tumor cell growth
- *Context*: Specific metabolic target
- *Research Focus*: GKI measurement and cancer outcomes

**23.** The GKI represents the "Paleolithic zone" where humans historically had no cancer
- *Context*: Historical metabolic state
- *Research Focus*: Ancestral metabolic markers

### **Case Studies & Clinical Applications**

**24.** Linda Nebeling successfully treated childhood brain cancer with ketogenic diet
- *Context*: Published case study
- *Research Focus*: Pediatric ketogenic cancer therapy

**25.** Pablo Kelly (glioblastoma) survived 10 years using only metabolic therapy without standard treatment
- *Context*: Dramatic survival case
- *Research Focus*: Metabolic monotherapy outcomes

**26.** Dog with mast cell tumor was resolved using raw food ketogenic approach
- *Context*: Veterinary application
- *Research Focus*: Ketogenic therapy in animal models

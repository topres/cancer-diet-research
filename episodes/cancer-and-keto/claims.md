## Diet/Keto/Prevention/Treatment Claims

### **Cancer Metabolism & Diet**

**1.** ~80% of cancers depend on fermentation energy (without oxygen) and require glucose and glutamine as fuels
- *Context*: Core metabolic theory claim
- *Research Focus*: Warburg effect and cancer cell metabolism

**2.** Higher blood sugar directly correlates with faster tumor growth; lower blood sugar correlates with slower tumor growth
- *Context*: Direct dietary intervention claim
- *Research Focus*: Glycemic control and tumor progression

**3.** Cancer cells cannot effectively burn ketones due to defective mitochondria, while normal cells can
- *Context*: Ketogenic diet therapeutic rationale
- *Research Focus*: Ketone metabolism in cancer vs normal cells

**4.** Ketones are "super fuel" - more energy efficient than glucose or fatty acids for healthy cells
- *Context*: Metabolic advantage claim
- *Research Focus*: Ketone body energy efficiency

### **Ketogenic Diet & Cancer Treatment**

**5.** Metabolic therapy (ketogenic approach) allows cancer patients to "outlive their predictabilities"
- *Context*: Survival benefit claim
- *Research Focus*: Ketogenic diet survival outcomes

**6.** Chemotherapy at lower doses is more effective when patients are in nutritional ketosis
- *Context*: Synergistic treatment claim
- *Research Focus*: Keto + chemotherapy combination studies

**7.** Hyperbaric oxygen therapy combined with ketogenic diet increased mouse survival by ~80%
- *Context*: Combination therapy claim
- *Research Focus*: Hyperbaric oxygen + ketogenic studies

### **Historical Diet & Cancer**

**8.** Cancer was extremely rare in traditional populations (African tribes, Arctic populations, Aboriginal peoples) living on ancestral diets
- *Context*: Traditional diet protection claim
- *Research Focus*: Epidemiological studies of traditional diets

**9.** Wild animals (wolves, chimpanzees, monkeys) don't get cancer on natural diets, but domestic animals do
- *Context*: Natural diet vs processed food
- *Research Focus*: Comparative oncology studies

### **Human Evolution & Ketosis**

**10.** Our ancestors had no cancer and no obesity while living in natural ketosis
- *Context*: Ancestral health claim
- *Research Focus*: Paleopathology and ancient health

### **Calorie Restriction & Cancer**

**11.** Calorie restriction in mice makes it "hard to get them to get tumors"
- *Context*: Caloric restriction as prevention
- *Research Focus*: CR and cancer incidence studies

**12.** Mice on calorie restriction had dramatically reduced breast cancer incidence
- *Context*: Specific cancer prevention claim
- *Research Focus*: CR and mammary tumor studies

### **Specific Dietary Components**

**13.** Processed carbohydrates directly promote cancer growth by feeding fermentation pathways
- *Context*: Specific food category harm
- *Research Focus*: Refined carbohydrates and cancer risk

**14.** Low glycemic index foods help maintain low glucose-ketone index (GKI) for cancer prevention
- *Context*: Food selection criteria
- *Research Focus*: Glycemic index and cancer outcomes

### **Glucose-Ketone Index (GKI)**

**15.** Maintaining a glucose-ketone index of 2.0 or below prevents tumor cell growth
- *Context*: Specific metabolic target
- *Research Focus*: GKI measurement and cancer outcomes

### **Case Studies & Clinical Applications**

**16.** Dog with mast cell tumor was resolved using raw food ketogenic approach
- *Context*: Veterinary application
- *Research Focus*: Ketogenic therapy in animal models

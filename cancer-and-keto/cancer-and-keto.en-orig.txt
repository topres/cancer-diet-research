cancer is very preventable when the medical establishment acknowledge what I know about this disorder what's causing it and what we're not doing to prevent it or treated it it will be recognized as the greatest tragedy in the history of medicine Thomas CA freed is a professor of biology genetics and biochemistry who has dedicated the past 30 years Gathering scientific evidence on what could be the true origin and prevention of cancer cancer is getting worse and there's no major advance in reducing death rates and I can speak to the reasons for that all major cancer research PL think cancer is a genetic disease you believe otherwise it's not whether you believe it's what the data tell us and the evidence is massive to support that cancer is a metabolic disorder and the problem is we're doing everything we possibly can in our lifestyle to induce it the scientific evidence is there like for example we know that cancer was extremely rare in African tribes that were living according to the traditional ways but when modern lifestyle entered into their societies cancer out of control we even did a study on THS we know that wolves in the wild don't die from cancer but cancer is the number one killer of domestic dogs why it's because of our lifestyle issues and a lot of us are doing things without the knowledge that it would put us at risk but with metabolic therapy you can use it as both a prevention and a treatment and we're seeing more and more of terminal cancer patients outliving their predictabilities because of this and let me tell you one thing and remember it if you do metabolic therapy you can actually reduce risk for cancer you can take away the fear and when you say metabolic therapy tell me what those before this episode starts I have a small favor to ask from you two months ago 74% of people that watched this channel didn't subscribe we're now down to 69% my goal is 50% so if you've ever liked any of the videos we've posted if you like this channel can you do me a quick favor and hit the Subscribe button it helps this channel more than you know and the bigger the channel gets as you've seen the bigger the guests get episode Professor C if someone walks up to you on the street and they're you know they know nothing about science and they know nothing about medicine Etc and they asked you what do you do and why do you do it how would you respond I'm a professor of biology at Boston College so uh in that role I spent a lot of my time working with undergraduates and graduate students in training them to be scientific literate in in various aspects of biology the research program that we have at the University is also Focus fed on understanding uh how to manage cancer better how it originates and how to prevent it how much of a problem is cancer globally what are the sort of headline statistics on the macro view of cancer for someone that really doesn't know yeah well it's getting worse uh I can't say there it's in the millions I I I know precisely what's going on in this country because the American Cancer Society uh every year uh distributes the data on on cancer um we have almost two million new cases diagnosed per year in the United States and we have 1,700 people a day dying from cancer in in the United States which comes to about 70 people per hour in the United States now when I went to China I looked at some numbers there and it was 8,000 people a day are dying from cancer obviously the population is so much larger and uh I don't know what it is in the UK I mean we'd have to go to their cancer Registries but but what we do know is that it's supposed to be a lot worse by 2050 than it is today so there seems to be no reduction in death suffering for this disease and I I can speak to the the reasons for that but right now I would say it's a global uh epidemic of cancer it's not it's not getting better it's getting worse more people are dying from it there's no major advance in in reducing death rates so it's a great tragedy so um and when we when we understand what's causing it and what we're not doing to prevent it or treat it it'll it'll be recognized as the singular greatest tragedy in the history of of medicine worldwide when it when when they come to know what I know about this disorder and then they realize what we've been doing in in in in in a misdirected way it will be recognized as the greatest tragedy in the history of medicine what Tye types of cancer are people dying from what is the most popular types of cancer for men and women well it's always been lung cancer pretty much for men and women uh lung cancer has always been the number one but but we have pancreatic breast cancer colon cancer these are all on the rise colon cancer is on the rise pancreatic cancer is on the rise in this country I I I I can't speak for other countries they may dare very slightly due to diet lifestyle issues but lung cancer has always been recognized as as the number one cancer how many people in the United States then based on the statistics would develop cancer well it seems to increase every year so it's kind of a moving Target it doesn't seem to go down you know what it is today I don't know but what I do know is the numbers of people that are dying each day because the um American Cancer Society comes out with I think it's 612,000 people uh will die this year 2024 uh from cancer in this year so divide it by 365 and it comes out to just about 1,700 people a day divide that number by 24 and you get about 70 people an hour based on the numbers provided to us from the American Cancer Society when they say we've made major advances in man in cancer incidences right so in the 1990s they instituted the uh anti-smoking campaigns all right so today if you read they say we have reduced cancer deaths by 30 31 or 32% wow that sounds really impressive so what they do is they take the number this is what the national the American Cancer Society has done and published in their papers okay if we didn't stop smoking in the 90s and everybody continued to smoke the trajectory would be very very high because we stopped smoking or this it's we have 33% lower death than if we didn't stop smoking but the trajectory is continuing to increase maybe not as steep as it would have been had we continued to smoke so it's it was clearly a prevention it had nothing to do with a a treatment it had to do with prevention that was giving the the the oh we've made major advances in in reducing cancer death rate yeah because people sto smoking for the mo for many many people more people would have died had they not smoked so we have um people that are not not real people we're just looking at what would have happened if if we didn't stop smoking what are the leading causes of death worldwide in terms of diseases is is I I hear that heart disease is number one I think that's heart disease is number one uh cancer is number two okay and there are many different types of cancer right there's hundreds of different forms of cancer if you look under the electron microscope or a correction even a light micro this is how most cancers are diagnosed by by light microscopy uh you look under the microscope and you see a bunch of cells that are dysmorphic in the way they look and then they all have genetic defects and all this kind of stuff but they all have one thing in common they depend on a on a fermentation energy without oxygen so all cancers are a singular type of disease it's just that they happen in different tissues but when you look at the underlying problem they're all very very similar they can't live uh without a fermentation which means energy without oxygen so that's the common pathophysiological problem in all cancers whether it's a colon brain breast bladder skin uh lung we we've looked at all these cancers and they're all they're all essentially using the same mechanism to to grow out of control so what is that F fermentation you mentioned fermentation is energy without oxy what does that mean uh we breathe air and we uh exhale CO2 and water vapor and those are the waste products of the food that we eat we break everything is broken down and combusted in our mitochondria of the cell and the waste products are Co 2 and water Vapors those are the waste products but if you and I were to stop breathing for any particular time period uh uh our bodies would fill up with uh lactic acid and succinic acid like if we were to have a heart attack or when somebody has a heart attack um they don't die instantly uh if if they if they're there without for five or seven minutes without oxygen they they may die because the brain dies but if you can get the heart to beat again and get oxygen back in the system you can come alive again but when we have that massive Interruption of oxygen into our body um the cells fall back on an ancient they up they immediately turn on these ancient Pathways to get energy without oxygen for a short period of time and that's the sugar glucose which is already in our bloodstream from the food we eat and the amino acid glutamine which is a high amino acid in our bloodstreams highest level of amino acid is the glutamine these two fuels are now burned for energy obtain energy without oxygen there's no there's a these Pathways upregulate and you can get ATP which is energy to keep you alive for a short period of time but your bloodstream is filling up with the waste products called lactic acid and succinic acid lactic acid is coming from glucose to sugar and succinic acid is coming from the amino acid glutamine and they build up and that tells you you're fermenting you're getting energy without oxygen because you're not breathing very simple you're not breathing but I'm Not Dead Yet now of course if you don't get it for very long you die it's just that now the other way you can stop uh oxygenation in our bodies quickly is with the poison cyanide so if we God forbid we were to take cyanide we'd be both dead within within a minute we just just because our bodies are completely shut down of energy from oxygen now here's the cancer cell the cancer cell lives in in can live in in cyanide cyanide does not kill a tumor okay War a warberg showed this a long time ago and we've also shown the same thing in our lab others have shown this the interesting thing is when you look at cancer cells even in the presence of oxygen even in oxygen they're throwing out lactic acid and succinic acid what does that mean that means the en the organ organel inside the cell that generates energy is not efficient it's inefficient and the cells are using ancient fermentation and when I say ancient fermentation you have to realize the Earth is 4 and a half billion years old um the organisms that existed on our planet uh two and a half billion years ago were all fermenters there was no oxygen in the atmosphere till the photosynthetic bacteria started making oxygen they were living cells they had no oxygen and they were growing like crazy unregulated growth just unreg what's going on here and they would die as soon as the mble fuels were dissipated as they gobbled up everything they would just die so they lived as long as they could reproduce and have fermentation fuels the cancer cell in our body is doing nothing than falling back on these ancient fermentation Pathways that become accelerated up regulated in the tumor cell because the efficiency of the energy coming from the mitochondria is now uh depleted it's defective in many different ways so this is very clear and this happens in lung cancer colon canc we've looked at all the major Cancers and we found out these common defects are seen in all the cancers so they're all very similar in their metabolism they're very different in what they look like under the microscope lung doesn't look like colon doesn't look like brain um they're very different genetically they're all different from each other but they're all common in a in a dependency on this ancient pathway of energy metabolism can you take me back you mentioned a guy called Walberg there yeah can you take me back on the journey that the scientific community or at least you have been on to arrive at the conclusion that the central sort of causal Factor at least an indication of a causal factor of cancer lies in this shift in Energy Systems where did this understanding start in in research well it started with Oto warberg for sure uh in the 1920s uh the other linkage before I tell you what OT warberg did because I was like everybody else I thought cancer was a genetic disease and and I heard about warberg didn't really know what what he was talking about or invested any time thinking about what he said but Linda nebling was a PhD nursing student at Case Western Reserve University and in Ohio and she took these two little hopeless kids brain cancer we call hopeless cases when they have no um predictability of long-term survival and she gave them a ketogenic diet to lower blood sugar and she was able to rescue these kids one one one eventually died the other one was lost to followup and she said it her strategy was based on what OT warberg had said about glucose and cancer so then I said warberg I said who the hell what let me go back and check out who this guy was and what he did because I was seeing similar things in the in the mouse with that drug it was lowering glucose and and we were sh shrinking these tumor cells and we published a paper uh the first one of the first ever papers linking that how high your blood sugar is determines how fast your tumor will grow in the mice and now how this been replicated in all human cancers the higher your blood sugar the faster the tumor grows the lower the blood sugar the slower the tumor grows undeniable for all different human Mouse cancers wow so warberg had said this a long time ago back in the 1920s he he was taking slices of all kinds of human and rat mouse tumors and slicing them up and he noticed something really strange about these um cancers they take in less oxygen compared to the normal tissue from which they came wow so they're kind of like oxygen deprived and they were throwing out this lactic acid waste product that he was that he was saying and they were taking in so much more glucose than the normal so the normal cells take in just a little bit of glucose and they can make tremendous energy from a tiny amount this guy was taking in huge amounts of glucose but not fully metabolizing it to CO2 and water but dumping it out as lactic acid which is a a breakdown product of glucose that is not fully metabolized in the cell wow he said this is unbelievable and then he did all kinds of tissue I looked at his data was unbelievable he was cutting humans mice rats and seeing the same thing over and over again and uh he was saying the origin of cancer has to do with something in the ability of the mitochondrian the organel to generate efficient energy from oxygen so the sorry the mitochondria is the part of the cell that creates energy it's the part of the cell that creates energy through oxidative phosphorilation which is burning energy using oxygen okay okay so it's like an engine it's an engine a very highly efficient engine that this is an organel you have to realize we have the cell yeah and we have a nucleus that every everybody knows about this nucleus and then we have all these little organel in there we have lomes and we have the mitochondrian which is like a spaghetti Network inside the cell they fuse it's actually a second living it's a second living organism inside our cells and to simplify what they do the mitochondria they convert oxygen and glucose into energy yes and they combust uh energy uh they they take the foods that we eat have carbon hydrogen bonds okay and we break those down inside our mitochondria and we and we and we when we break those bonds down we create a a hydrogen gradient and we dissipate that gradient through an impeller mechanism that generates energy like crazy it's unbelievable very efficient highly efficient but the cancer cell has corruption in that system but it doesn't happen overnight as warberg said if you break that system too acutely and too fast the cell will die it doesn't have the so you have to have two things to get from oxidative phosphorilation to uh energy with with with minimal oxygen fermentation sorry just to keep it simple from a normal cell to a cancer cell from a normal cell to a cancer cell doesn't happen overnight okay it's a chronic damage to the ability of of that organel inside the cell to generate efficient energy okay so all we have to know with cancer is that they're how are they growing so rapidly why are they going out of control how come it's so hard to kill them because as long as you have those fermentable fuels that drive this ancient fermentation pathway um they will continue to grow they're very hard to kill and the fermenting fuels are glucose and and glutamine glutamine yeah okay so here let's let me tell you in a nut are are you ready brace yourself are you ready I'm ready are you braced are you braced sufficiently bra sufficient he's sufficiently braced okay so uh a solution to the cancer problem to manage cancer without toxicity is to simultaneously restrict the two fuels that are needed to drive this disregulated growth while transitioning the whole body off to a fuel that the tumor cells can't use which is fatty acids and Ketone bodies so when we take the cancer patients or the mice we put them into a calorie restriction lowering the blood sugar uh that I said is one half of the two fuels you can lower that down really really low and then we use specific drugs to Target the glutamine and together we can selectively restrict the two fuels while we transition the whole body over to to ketones we as a species evolved to be in nutritional ketosis for the the majority of our existence as a as a species like one and a half million years for for centuries and centuries thousands and thousands of years our species you and me our ancestors were always in a state of nutritional ketosis because there was very few carbohydrates in the environment for them to be consuming right so the cancer cell the body you and I could if we stopped eating and we took a low carbohydrate diet and just did water only fasting we would get into nutritional ketosis where the normal cells our brain our kidneys our heart can be burning these Ketone bodies because they have a good mitochondria and they can burn these fuels effectively the tumor cells have a bad mitochondria they can't burn those fuels they're dependent on glucose and glutamine we can replace glucose and glutamine with Ketone bodies in the normal cells of our so we selectively marginalize these tumor cells slowly over time uh we they slowly start to Die the blood vessels disappear and the body comes in and dissolves them so for someone that has never heard the term keto before ketosis or ketones in a simple way what are KET ketones ketones are water soluble breakdown products of fatty acids okay they're beta hydroxy beate acetoacetate these are small molecules that are water soluble the liver throws them out like crazy kidney a little bit but mostly liver so as I told you earlier when we don't eat um you you get anxious mainly because our brains are addicted to glucose it's like cocaine and nicotine and whatever you start getting all antsy haven't eaten anything you know uh what's going on um so you then once the body realizes you ain't going to eat anything we have to start mobilizing out of our fat resources and the fats uh go into the bloodstream as triglycerides which are three fatty acids attached to a glycerol backbone they go to the liver the liver chops them up and puts out these little water soluble Ketone bodies that the name Ketone body is kind of a weird thing from biochemistry but but they're called Ketone bodies um and they can supply the brain with energy the heart with energy and not only that they're a super fuel it's unbelievable that mitochondria Burns these ketones okay but they ener remember I was talking about how energy efficient the mitochondria become when they burn ketones they become even more energy efficient it's unbelievable how you you they don't need as much oxygen to generate more en that's why they my colleagues called and some of the greats in the bio in the biochemistry field called them super super fuel because you can get more energy bang for buck burning a ketone body than you can burning a pyruvate coming from glucose or even a fatty acid uh and the biochemistry for that is is interesting but but the bottom line is when you transition away from these fuels to ke we don't forget we evolved our our ketosis you get into that state by consuming very few carbohydrates and having a lot of energy and this is the way our ancestors were so what can we learn from our ancestors about cancer how prevalent was cancer um when we look back at our ancestors if they were often in a state of ketosis yeah well um it's hard to determine uh from skeletal records uh but I think we can look at U um modern pop modern man who live according to their traditional ways um you know uh Albert schwitzer the Great humanitarian physician went to Africa and looked at Africans that were living according to the traditional ways and he said one of the weirdest things they don't have cancer it was like what what uh cancer was extremely rare in Africans in ints living in in the in the areas British when they came you know in in in looking at the health conditions of folks that lived in the Arctic Circle cancer was not there they had other things but they didn't have cancer um Aboriginal folks so it seems as though uh our living we we can't go back 50,000 years ago because we don't have people to examine but we have people to examine today and that was one of the things schwitzer and several other Physicians from Europe would go to Africa and they would look at these some of these tribes that were traditional and they would say whoa what's going on with these Africans how come they don't have but when modern diet lifestyle entered into their societies cancer out of control what about what about our the primate cousins yeah um there's never been a documented uh case a breast cancer in a female chimpanzee uh and they're 98% similar to us in Gene and protein sequence uh you know what's going on with that um monkeys uh they don't generally form cancer they're eating they're not eating what we eat okay don't forget we did not evolve to eat pork pies and Dunkin Donuts jelly fil donnuts and pizzas we did not our ancestors did not eat this right we were killing and eating Animals As I said we ate everything that walked crawled flew or swam on this planet became part of our diet um we did not have Donuts on every corner delicate essin on every corner our we evolved over this period of time just like our primate ancestors uh the animals chimps and gorillas and things that you see in the zoos are fed their natural diets as if they were living in in their habitat their natural habitat whether it was in South America Africa or wherever it was were're not throwing in jelly donuts every day and pizza pie into the chimpanzee pen and as a matter of fact I even went to the zoo down down here in in Boston Franklin Park Zoo and also at the San Diego Zoo I said how come how come you guys don't give these guys run down and get a big pizza for these for these animals oh no it' be animal cruelty their systems aren't Geared for we we have an obesity epidemic we have all these different chronic diseases why we didn't have to eat all this crap that we're eating today so what I've told many people in these podcasts is that our food science and technology and our society's technology has evolved so much faster than our biology can you explain to me in simple terms the role the exercises playing in staving of cancer well exercise lowers blood sugar you know you and and also lowers glutamine so uh the two fuels that are driving uh now we can't completely remove glutamine by exercise that's for sure um but we my my late good friend George kahill published some papers on showing how exercise could actually lower uh glutamine availability so it's a it's a little bit of a push but you're also when you exercise you're burning and you're not eating a lot of carbs your mitochondria burning ketones and the oxygenation from all the exercise is keeping those mitochondria super healthy at their highest level of Energy Efficiency so exercise you're building muscle as well aren't you yeah you're building well you can build muscle but you're certainly getting aerobic exercise to oxygen is coming in and you're burning ketones which I already told you is a super fuel so your body is super healthy uh these bodies from the Paleolithic period these men were jacked there was no obesity in these people they had tremendous energy they're they're not dying from uh the things that are killing us they're dying from injuries and infections when you described this slow and gradual shift in the cell as it moves to this sort of ancient system it sounded very gradual so in my I thought okay so does that mean that the cancer is a gradual process that is kind of building up in me or isn't building up in Me based on the lifestyle decisions I'm making and my environmental factors right now like I'm trying to say does is does cancer start slowly years before you you you know you find it is a gradual process but it can be impacted by several provocative Agents from the from the micro environment um lack of exercise okay so we're not exercising nearly as much as our Paleolithic ancestors Bar None right we have massive amounts of processed carbs in our diets we have a lot of emotional stress uh um mental emotional stress that's impacting negatively on on our biology um we we have lack of sleep sleep uh a lot of us because we we have stresses you you have to have when you put all of these impact act ful things together in one person you can put yourself at risk for Cancer all of which will damage and reduce the efficiency of mitochondria and also the joy of living uh having friends and friendships and and this kind of thing reduces stress in a lot of different ways makes people enjoy getting up and and having a a nice day rather than being depressed or or these kinds of things um you put all all this together and you put yourself in a a diet and lifestyle that puts you at risk for damage to oxidative phosphorilation and the transition from one form of energy to a fermentation energy and what I'm trying to understand is that a it's a grad a gradual transition you have to be able to do that and how long does it take for a colon a group of cells in a in a in a crypt of your colon to transition from one stage to another you have to be constantly under stress those cells and that organ now why somebody gets colon cancer another person gets breast cancer another person gets black cancer and some person gets a brain cancer and all these different kinds of cancers what whatever happened the process was dis was causing a gradual disruption of oxidative phosphorilation oxidative respiration and a and a gradual transition to a fermentation like in the brain the neurons rarely if ever get cancer but the gal cells that support neurons they are usually the source of the origin of cancer in the brain for those kinds of cells and you can look at different cells and some are more or less prone and why this guy got lung cancer from from smoking cigarettes this guy got bladder cancer from smoking cigarettes how did it all start it all started from a population of cells in one of those organs having an a chronic not instant a chronic Interruption of oxidative energy followed by an upregulation of this fermentation energy so really we need to be thinking about all the things that have caused dysfunction in the mitochondria absolutely I want to get a list of the key things that are associated with causing this dysfunction okay carcinogens okay so carcinogens and you know there's many asbesto there's all kinds of chemicals in the environment you hear about this oh there's a whole list of carcinogens we and they put them on the on the labels on different chemicals they say carcinogenic potential and whatever you have what are the types of things that are C cogenic that most people don't realize oh well now we're talking about microplastics we're talking about um is that in part what causes breast cancer cuz I always think about dooen with breast cancer and and the stuff that we're kind of lathering onto our arm yeah well the the one that was was most interesting was the talcum powder one how does talcum powder would cause ovarian cancer okay it's taken up into the urogenital tract and it forms a fosi in in a part of the ovarian tissue what's a fosi a Locus like a collection of material a fosi is a an area where say talum materials would be accumulating and that leads to a inflammatory um area of the body and our immune system comes in to see what's going on our immune system is a healing machine and they see something that's not not normal normally they would clean it up but they throw grow cyto kindes and growth factors on there leading to disregulated damage to mitochondria and disregulated it and then you get this tumor that starts so if I get a talcum powed uh granule or whatever and it goes into my body my body then tries to attack it to sort of out and in doing so it creates inflammation which leads to damage to mitochondria in a particular group of cells near that fosi okay and this this is applicable to I guess a lot of different Nano particles and yeah and microplastics are this now they're looking at this but then we have chemical carcinogens tetrahydrochloride there's all kinds of other things that can actually damage arsenics and and these kinds of chemicals um urethane uh anything that could chronically damage uh a mitochondrian forcing over time for ing it to upregulate the fermentation energy without oxygen isn't this most things I'm trying to figure out what I how to live my life yeah well that's what that that's why it was called the oncogenic Paradox but but you can you can avoid that that's why I'm saying if you can keep your mitochondria healthy how exercise and reduce uh consumption of Highly processed carbohydrates do I need to be avoiding these microplastics as well you you know the problem with microplastics they're very ubiquitous we're not really sure uh we just now becoming aware of it nobody really knew that before um look it up it's but it could it could cause U small fosi in different populations of cells but you know it's very hard to really chronically damage mitochondria mitochondria a tough organel the problem is we are chronically abuse it without realizing what we need to do to keep it healthy so even if you are exposed to chemical carcinogens even if you are exposed to all these things but you're keeping your body as healthy as you possibly can you could possibly delay or even prevent the damage to the mitochondria even though you have the even though you are being exposed to this so it's a it's actually in your hands um you can actually reduce risk for cancer by knowing what keeps your mitochondria healthy vigorous exercise uh fasting water only fasting um you know it's very hard some but sometimes we when we were putting mice on calorie restriction it was hard to get them to get tumors their body was so healthy this was shown Years Ago by by a couple of scientists in mice using mice with that developed a lot of breast cancer if you put them on a calorie restricted diet the incidence was way way down so cancer is very preventable it's a very preventable uh disorder it's just that we're doing everything we possibly can induce it in our diet lifestyle a lot of big institutions believe that cancer is a genetic problem um you believe otherwise the evidence is striking I mean to believe it's not tell us okay so according to the somatic mutation theory of cancers mutations in the nucleus lead to disregulated cell growth that's the sematic mutation theory in the mitochondrial metabolic Theory it's a transition from oxidative phosphorilation to to a fermentation metabolism inside inside the cell um the mutations are largely irrelevant what do you mean by that when the mitochondria become defective they throw out Ros reactive oxygen species that are carcinogenic and mutogenic W what does that mean causing mutations so a lot of the mutations that we see in the nucleus of the tumor cell that is the subject of the sematic mutation Theory are Downstream effects of the dysfunction of the mitochondria so the mitochondria is causing a downstream effect which are mutations which according to the sematic mutation Theory are the cause of the disregulated cell growth let me tell you why that's absolutely untrue there's some cancer cells growing out of control have no mutations and normally not discuss how can that be that's a a challenge to the theory if the theory says that all cancers have mutations and you have some cancers that have no mutations and they're growing out of control that should say who bell ring one uh then they the the sematic mutation uh people people who think this said oh okay we have we have a problem here not all mutations are the ones that cause the disregulated only some and we have a name for those some that's called driver mut okay now it's a nice term because some of those mutations are called passengers they don't really do anything but the drivers are the ones that lead to the disregulated cell growth so we should be focusing our attention on these driver mutations new evidence from the recent scientific literature can you believe this they're taking tissue normal tissues from patients different organs and things like this from not patients from normal people no cancer perfectly like yourself here we would take tissue from you and say oh my Christ look at the you got driver mutation in your esophagus and your different parts of your body you got driver but you don't have a tumor what's going on with that how you explain that these driver mutations are causing disregulated cell growth when we have thousands of driver mutations that are there that are not causing disregulated cell growth oh okay that's a another problem the biggest devastating information against the somatic mutation theory is if you take the nucleus from a tumor cell cleanly take it out of the tumor cell and you have another normal cell here you take the nor the nucleus out of the normal cell and you put the tumor cell into that cytoplasm you get regulated growth no disregulated growth but if I have the normal cell and have a tumor cell take the tumor nucleus out of there and take the normal nucleus and put it into the tumor cytoplasm which contains mitochondri defective mitoch disregulated cell Dr this has been seen over and over and over again so just to summarize that so if you take the tumor nucleus side of the cell and put it into a a normal healthy cell yes um everything's fine everything is fine but if you take take healthy cell nucleus and put it into a tumor cell you still have the same dis regulated cell growth tumor growth so which means that it's not the nucleus absolutely it's something else it's something else and that's the mitochondria and I told you then you have cancer cells with no mutations and then you have driver mutations and normal cells that never become cancer you put all those things together and you have to be uh a hopeless ideologue to think that cancer is a genetic disease um it's a silent assumption in the field that cancer is a genetic every textbook of biology cell biology and bio cancer is a genetic disease why hasn't people's opinions changed despite the evidence that you present it's a very difficult thing it goes back to um when you have one Theory replacing another theory it's called Paradigm Paradigm shifts and in all in history of science Paradigm shifts have been met with great great resistance uh the clear the clearest one was the Kernan Revolution when uh for eight 1,800 years astronomers in our early Astron astronomers thought the Earth was immovable in the center of the solar system for 1,000 this was Claudius TMI Aristotle and the Bible and all these Earth is immovable and the Sun and the Moon and the planets all revolve around the earth 1,800 years even Cernic's uh was working with these mathematical formulations this kep was being constantly confused until he said what happens if we put the sun in the center of the solar system and consider the Earth as simply another planet that would revolve oh all of a sudden things started to make sense and gardano Bruno uh a theologian was put to death for suggesting that cernus was right um there was a tremendous resistance on the part of the Roman Catholic Church at that time and this is the same thing that happened when when and um Lewis Pastor said the germs the germs rather than bad air are the cause of disease so uh and when Darwin Wallace theory of evolution came it's not special creation it's it's natural selection that that can explain this these were massive Paradigm changes in the history of Science and what we're seeing today is the same thing the mitochondria is the center of the problem with cancer not the nucleus the mitochondria it's a mitochondrial metabolic disease and once you realize that we're going to drop these death rates massively in a very a number of years for sure so if we take two paths then if we realize that that the mitochondria is the center of the dysfunction and ultimately disease in the cell yes if we go that down that path what impact do you think that will have on the canc cancer statistics over the coming years it'll drop it massively okay I'm not going to say we'll get rid of cancer completely uh but here's the thing we may never get rid of it but we can learn to live with it and keep it at Bay if if we know how to if we know that it can't survive without these two fuels and you can do a diet and lifestyle that can restrict the availability of those two fuels and keep your mitochondria as healthy as you possibly can what if we don't go down that path what you think then you're going to be right one out of two people are going to be having cancer that your statistics are going to be U AB absolutely correct is there anybody that you believe because you know when we talk about these subjects often we think of like big Farmer and the incentives and money and follow the money and you'll figure out why people don't want change are is any of that sort of conspiratorial thinking correct in your view are they I don't know if that's conspiracy I don't like conspiracy terms that's absurds I like what are the facts of what we're looking at but do you see a resistance from Big farmer to entertain this point of view um what do you think what do you think I mean do you think this is I mean you're making a lot of not you but but people in these in that those Industries the hospital industry is making enormous amounts of money they're rewarding we get uh7 billion a year for cancer research in the in the in in the National Cancer Institute awarding gr many many not all many grants to look at for gene mutations and all this kind of stuff um and we have drugs that are extremely expensive based on a sematic mutation theory of cancer that are basically not dropping the death rate as I said we got while we're talking here we're g to have 140 people dead uh from cancer uh 1,700 people years getting worse and worse um with as you said we're always running for raising money for cancer research uh where's all that money going what are you doing with all that money no accountability and then when you look at the scientific advisory committee of all these societies that you're running for they all think published papers on cancer as a genetic disease it's too hard for the field to accept at this point um it's it's too traumatic at what I'm saying it's too disruptive to a a massive industry uh at this time they will come to gradually adjust to what I'm saying it's just a matter of time because we cannot continue this trajectory it's immoral what we're doing to some of these people I read a St that said the global incidence of early onset cancer increased by roughly 80% between 1990 yeah and 2019 that's in the bmj oncology um early onset of cancer is basically patients under the age of 50 and and when I think about this you know growing up in the UK whenever there's a a fun run a charity race a marathon whatever it might be cancer research get the money yeah and to hear that you know there's been so much money invested in cancer research over the last couple of decades but there's been an increase of 80% in early onset cancer in the same period for me I'm like this research doesn't appear to be do being very effective well as I said you got to find what people don't do is they never ask where's the research go what kind of research what what are you doing what is the research it's the theory that drives the the impetus to do research now a lot of great stuff has been done on you know keeping people alive that suffer from cancers right because if you think about the probability of dying from a cancer I'm I'm assuming that has gone down yeah uh to some extent it has you know we call there's two ways of looking it's called Uh progression free survival and overall survival uh these are the terminologies that are used in the clinical world of cancer uh uh and they represent the approval of drugs through the Food and Drug Administration if you have a drug that improves a progression free survival uh progression free means it looks like the drug is working on the tumor um because you know the tumor you can see it it gets bigger and bigger and more lethal and more lethal and and if I see it not growing nearly as much uh I say wow look at the it's it's slowing the what we call traditional progression okay it's called progression free survival and then you have overall survival so you have two ways to approve drugs mostly for cancer right how does it work on aggression free survival and how does it work on overall survival well they stop looking at overall survival now somebody's going to bark and say well you know bottom line is mostly progression free which means that the patients it looks like the tumor is being effectively managed but they live only a couple of months longer than they would have if they didn't use this drug so therefore it's approved and and and um that as opposed to overall survival you know you're only living a two okay You' lived two and a half extra months the tumor looked like it was manage pretty well but your overall survival is is this much but you you didn't see the tumor growing uh we're going to improve that drug so a lot of the new drugs that we're giving do a really good job at progression free survival but they do a horrible job in keeping people alive much longer which ultimately is what you want to do you want overall survival let me give you an example avastin uh bismid this this is an immoral drug that should never be used on people it was blocked because it caused colon perforations in women with breast cancer they still use it on brain cancer and when you so the in the tumor you got a A tumor you can see it with PET Imaging and you can not so much pet MRI and Cat Scan you can see it there and it's looking there okay uh you can see it now you give the patient a vaston and uh which is this um anti-angiogenic drug it's supposed to stop the abnormal blood vessels right they think that the angiogenesis blood vessels is is driving the disregulated growth it's the fermentation that's driving the just regulated growth by the way so all of a sudden you give the the tumor kind of disappears it doesn't look like it whoa patient gets all excited The Physician looks and says look at that look at the looks like you're doing well what it does the EV what the drug does is it causes the tumors permeate your enti your entire brain just like spreading it through your whole brain you don't live any longer uh but you had this progression free look at the tumor so the patient gets excited because it looks like the tumor's disa appearing with this very expensive drug but what it does is it almost guarantees that that patient will not survive because you spread the tumor cells through the whole brain so um this is why I call it an immoral kind of a thing but chemotherapy and sort of these radiation therapies they have proven to keep people alive who otherwise would have died in some cases they it can and and that's another thing we have to look at we have and I I work heavily in brain tumors and G blastomas and things like that when you irradiate somebody's brain uh who has one of these tumors you free up massive amounts of glucose and glutamine in the micro environment and if you look at the survival when we did survival looked at survival curves for gleo blast throughout the world oh it's un you can't even design experiments so consistent how fast people will die it's like all the different hospitals have the same survival same survival what are you doing well we do chemo we do surgical debulking uh T olomide and we give steroids which raise blood sugar and we irradiate we irradiate we irradiate everybody's dead so um not everybody but you know fiveyear survival is is very very low 10e survival is almost zero um but if you go if you got a breast cancer or if you got this is brain cancer I'm talking about this is freeing up now yes if you have a circumscribed tumor and it's not anywhere else you can come in with a radiation or surgical procedure and cure essentially cure that patient but if you have any level of spread or anything like this um that that person now and also if you're taking a toxic poison into your body like Red Devil docar rubison they call it Red Devil your P turns red everything turns red what is that is that chemotherapy yes is a chemotherapy to kill a small group of cells um or maybe a little bit of a spread but your your hair falls out your body gets brutalized uh by this and then if you survive the cancer and many people do we have millions and millions of cancer survivers on this planet but many many folks in that group suffer from the adverse effects of being p poisoned or irradiated or surgically mutilated I mean they have to change their whole and often times the cancer comes back or they die from cardiovascular disease or they die from secondary adverse effects of being brutalized uh with medieval I call it medieval approaches to this are you kidding me what they're doing to cancer patients so when we do metabolic therapy we we shrink the tumor down for sure then the surgeon can come in and he sees it smaller fewer blood vessels because of the metab therapy and we can take out a greater amount uh of of this and then we transition back to prevent this tumor from recurring metabolic therapy can be used to not only prevent the cancer but can also be used to treat the cancer now let me tell you go most hospitals suppose people say well you know I really want to do things to prevent cancer can I do standard of care before I have a tumor what do you mean you want to go into a uh major Cancer Clinic and have toxic doxorubicin and radiation to your body just in the event that you might get a cancer this is absurd but yet when you have cancer that's what they do to you right but with metabolic therapy you can use it as both a prevention and a treatment it's just that with a treatment we bring in some more drugs to Target the glutamine we don't do that on the prevention side on the I was just looking at some stats as you were speaking around the fiveyear survival rates of a variety of different cancers um over time and it does appear that survival rates of these cancers from breast cancer to prostate cancer to lung cancer to leukemias um and various melanomas has improved since the 1970s so the 1970s to the 1990s to the 2010s there's been an improvement in the survival rate um which I guess is a credit to the research that's been done um what you're saying is that this the treatments we have still today are horrific yeah and the and the survivals are not that much greater it's not like you're getting massively longer survivals yeah I mean and I have to I I have to preface that these stats might not be right because this is AI we're dealing with here but the there's a 5% for example with breast cancer between the 1990s and 2010 there's just a 5% difference in overall survival in overall survival okay so your survival your overall survival is two and a half to three months greater I I don't actually have those stats in no but that's that's that's the the evidence the papers that we're looking at so so how do we prevent prevent this then I'm 32 years old now so I want to make sure that I live my life in such a way that I limit my chance of cancer one of the things I always reflect on is the fact that many of the people that I know that have got cancer breast cancer or other forms of cancer appear to be remarkably healthy yeah always at the beginning there there not always but many times the person comes in gee I just was diagnosed with cancer I didn't know I had it I didn't feel bad I didn't and then all of a sudden you get treated and they look like death warmed over but I'm saying like how can how can healthy people be getting cancer if there's this sort of central well because you I as I said are the the the the and we're seeing this I'm seeing it in my own I'm getting more and more emails from young people in their 30s uh late 20s 30s early 40s like with colon cancer breast cancer and all these kinds of things but look at our diet and lifestyle situation today those those things that I'm talking about lack of exercise a lot of stress poor sleep bad food all of this kind of stuff impacting parts of our bodies so what do we do about it though know about it and then and then what do we do so I know that's personal choice I'm not here to take pieces and and jelly donuts off the market for sure or breakfast here I love that stuff too but the qu the question is I don't eat it me so so yeah skipping meals water only fat occasionally there's a lot of things you can do to keep your mitochondria healthy okay so tell me what those things are I just exercise you look like you're a pretty healthy guy yeah I go to I go to the gym you don't look morbidly obese to me not not yet not yet well that's important because you don't ever want it yet we would't be in America too long so my chan well and listen it's not just the United States we were kind of like the first ones to plow that field but it's starting to spread everywhere I think in China they have the most 200 million obese people in China now so should I be on a keto diet then here's what we did okay uh we developed the glucose Ketone index calculator at Boston College all right my students and I because we were trying to uh work with cancer patients blood sugar and ketones um independently of each other we had a ketone meter and we had a blood glucose meter so we were monitoring ketones by itself and glucose by itself and we worked with a very nice woman U from American who lived in East France who since passed away from a brain stem tumor was very very difficult we kept her alive very long but eventually we didn't know what we need what we know now but she got into an argument for a handicapped parking spot with her neighbor upstairs and her blood sug and blood sugar went through the roof she ran upstairs and she took her blood blood sugar and she says oh my God the tumor is going to grow I said what's your ketones and she says oh it's still 2 and a half Miller well that's still pretty high usually it's very very low it's very high so my students and I we said you know this is too traumatic to try to measure these two independently why don't we make a singular number divide the glucose in molar in the blood by the Ketone and Molar in the blood now you get this number that's much more stable and it allows the cancer patient to know that if I keep this Zone in 2.0 and below my tumor cells aren't going to be able to grow very fast I did this for the brain cancer right now it's being used for all Cancers and now it's being used for guys like yourself who just want to stay healthy and because what it is essentially is a quantitative determination if you're in the Paleolithic zone or not oh so if I'm at 2.0 like my friend Dominic the austino he's always down in these zones he's living the P he's a Paleolithic man living in modern society what's a Paleolithic man that's how our ancestors were during the Paleolithic period okay so he's got the right balance of glucose and ketones in his blood like we did when we were hunting mammoths and and Buffalos and these kinds of things when we were hunter gatherers in the thousands of years of our existence as a species tens of thousands of years he is in that zone is he in keto yeah well that's that's what the low gki is that means you're at a level of Keto now yes he doesn't eat a lot of carbohydrates in his diets eats leafy vegetables and a lot of meat and and this kind of thing sparingly on fruits uh like grapefruits we learned from the epilepsy field great fruits provide a tremendous amount of vitamin C with don't and do not Spike glucose that's that's very interesting so you can have uh certain fruits that can keep you in this metabolic zone of P I call it the Paleolithic Zone which is the way we evolve with there was no cancer in our in our existence when people hear that they might start jumping on the paleo diet I don't even know what the not a paleo diet it's it's diets that are low in carbohydrates okay okay um Mediterranean diets like people say to me at told God what should I eat should I eat this and that normally you would eat foods that have very low low glycemic index which means the speed with which glucose is released like a banana very high in glycemic index you eat a banana your blood sugar immediately spikes many fruits are like that um but you want you want foods that keep a low steady uh uh gki now I built that uh calculator for brain cancer patients initially then we realize it's powerful for all cancers uh we put the cancer patient in the low glucose Ketone index we get them down in there then we come in with the glutamine targeting drugs to to kind of polish off these tumors or put them in even a more dormant state but now we finding all these young kid like yourself all these 30 20 year olds what's your gki I mean they're out to weightlifting and they're looking at their G they don't have cancer they're just excited to see they they can get into this Paleolithic Zone by themselves and that yes that will prevent cancer because you can't get cancer if your mitochondria healthy if if you're in a Paleolithic Zone where our ancestors rarely have ever got cancer then you're you're back in this oh you me to tell me I can't eat this and I can't eat that what does it do to your gki oh Mak it go up well don't eat that so you did a study on dogs a dog with a tumor yes can you tell me about that study it was a woman came to me and this is what I say does you don't have to have a a PhD in Biochemistry to understand what some of the things this woman had no degree whatsoever she just heard the uh about what we did to these mice and she did the same thing to her dog um it was a pitbull and at aged seven years old it had big mast cell tumor on its lip so she listened to my YouTube video over and over she said to me I just kept listening then he says I I got I I I I got some raw chicken she says dogs wolves evolved to eat chickens so she got some uh chicken Cho chopped up the chicken she cut the calories of she found some dog food calculator to how much calories the dog was getting she cut the calories the dog look lost only 5% of its body weight she got uh pollic fish oil raw eggs and cut all the calories everything was all natural for this dog um and all of a sudden we have the pictures you can see them in the P if you saw the picture big big tumor on its lip that the the veterinarians said this dog is gonna to survive you have to give him chemo and radiation and surgery and all this kind of stuff and it's going to cost a lot of money the dog's gonna have diarrhea it's going to be you know she didn't want any part of that so she said well let's just try this metabolic thing and and she kept all the records and the pictures and what she did and how much she gave the dog and all this so I was able to get all that information from her um put my friend Lauren Lauren Nations who was a veterinarian uh on the paper because I said what biology guy at Boston College is telling you how to manage cancer in a dog we got to have some veterinarian on here to validate to make sure he's there and he looked at the pictures and we looked at all the thing and disappeared so what happened was the dog eventually died of heart disease at 15 and a 12 years years of age so essentially that's the only when people say well metabolic therapy cure cancer I I say metabolic therapy is never considered a cure for cancer it's an effective non-toxic management for cancer but in the case of that dog it appeared to work to cure the dog but that's the only one I'll say oh he's gonna say cure cannot that dog happened to get he died from old age from a heart heart attack and we did it with a brain tumor guy Pablo Kelly who just passed away unfortunately from a from a surgical um his his uh had a a major cerebral uh Hemorrhage after his surgery from Devon England you know Devon England that's where I'm from are you from Devon yeah oh wow well Pablo was there he just passed away fortunately we've talking to him the day before he passed away Pablo Pablo Kelly so he was from Devon England had a gleo blastoma which is the worst of the worst uh they said and he's all over your your newspapers there and Devon he was always sending me articles from England um man rejects standard of care so he he had this gleo blastoma and they took the tissue out which is brain cancer yeah brain the worst of the brain cancers you know uh they took the tumor out and they said oh you it's in inoperable inoperable and uh but if you do radiation in chemo uh we you might live nine maybe 12 months at the most well Pablo came from a family of like we don't dabble and and this kind of medicine we're more holistic kind of people so he emailed me this was in 2014 um and said I want to try this metabolic thing so he rejected uh chemo and radiation and they said it wasn't surgically capable of being completely removed anyway so he did this I I gave him the information that I give to everybody and this was way back before we knew a lot of what we now know and uh I said this poor guy he sees another one and they said you're going to be dead they they brow beat him they try to force him to put the radiation mask on they hacked his beard off uh all this kind of stuff and he just jumped up he said I can't do this stuff so um he didn't take any steroids he didn't take any any radiation he didn't take any chemo he just did the metabolic therapy and he's on English telev or things with all of his paleo diet which actually a low very low carbohydrate diet he had the avocados there he had the fish oil there he had this different stuff two three years go by he emails me I said gez Pablo I thought you would have been dead you're still alive what's going on with that so so he calls me up and he says you know um I went in for a CAT scan the other day doctors are like still surprised that he's alive and they said this tumor is is still there and it's growing and they think they can cut it out now so he was three years on on just metabolic approach he didn't take any glutamine Inhibitors which was really remarkable so so anyway he asked me and I have I have physician friends that a radiologist that can look at it and we measured it when it was first first diagnosed in 2014 and then we saw it did become a little bigger so and the now the surgeon said I think I can get it looks more more receptable here it was inoperable now it becomes receptable so he took it out and um Pablo recovered really well and uh the surgeon says I think I got it all wow so so and and Pablo is measuring his glucose Ketone index with our Keo monitor so I had every day sometimes two and three five years of data on Pablo can you believe this so so anyway Pablo thinks he's cured because the the surgeon all of a sudden he goes back to his kind of weak weak ways and you can see the his gki goes up and all of a sudden the tumor starts to show up again puts the fear of God back into him goes back on a more restrict condition another three years goes by and this time the tumor is growing slowly very slow don't forget gleo blastomas kill you very quickly um with standard of care you can barely get out of at his age if you can get two years you're doing you're doing really good so anyway now he's three and he's got six years out and he says you know um uh it's still back you know he I got to go in so it first so this is second debul first debul goes off gets back on another second debulking another three years goes by he has a third debulking can you believe this the debulking debulking is the cutting the tumor out it's the removal surgical removal of this tumor but he's never had radiation or chemo or any of the kinds of stamp what we call standards of care so for and now um he he has uh I talked to him a couple of weeks ago and uh he was doing he was doing really really good he had the the third removal and we were laughing with myself and Dr duer and my associates he says yeah can you imagine um uh I've had now three operations on a tumor so we were saying wow they got that wrong didn't they follow and they kept wanting to irradiate him and do all this stuff and he said no no going to keep doing this and so we were speaking to him and and uh he's out 10 years the tumor was was diagnosed in in in August 2014 and he passed away August uh 2024 from they try to go in and get the last bit of tumor out of his brain he came out of we got him uh we talked to him a thumbs up smiling talking like crazy six hours later cereal hemr and need dies so uh he didn't die from the cancer he died from the a surgical problem with the surgery so he was a you talk about long-term survivors uh you rarely survive two years with a gleo blastoma the fact that he was out 10 years and if he hadn't had that last bit of surgery the guy would have still been alive because he was talking like you and I are talking this is a guy who has a a terminal so I said to Pablo I said you could outlive me I I says I said we're all terminal to some extent right we're never all of us aren't going to live to I said sure he was a young guy he was only 20 22 or 23 when he was diagnosed he was in his 30s now when he passed away 10 years so he's 33 34 years old and and I said you know I could be dead before you and we were laughing and we had a good time and then next thing I know I got an email from his wife he said Pablo is is on on on on brain dead and something I said what the hell happened what happened to this poor guy and it wasn't the cancer so um who how know I don't know what how long you would have lived how many more things but what I'm saying oh he's an anecdote well listen if I had a drug that did what what metabolic therapy did and I could get more people like Pablo are you kidding me they'd be run running all over the world and when you say metabolic therapy you mean the combination of the calorie restrictive yeah ketogenic approach yes avoiding well first of all you're avoiding you're avoiding things that are going to kill you the radiation is going to kill you for the for many people not all people okay everybody say well well listen you can you can look at go have people look at the data themselves for crying out loud and you can see how long you're going to live he didn't do what they what they grab everybody in what did he do specifically he didn't take radiation or chemo yeah and he brought his glucose Ketone index down to the 2.0 Zone and kept it kept it low and he took some supplements and a few things here and there but he wasn't really targeting the glutamine like we thought it with like we we thought we we found now certain parasite medications will be effective in targeting glutamine so we're doing all non-toxic strategies to manage cancer you don't have to be brutalized by the system if you know what to do and how to do it the problem the problem is most of the poor oncologists never heard of what I'm talking the stuff I'm telling you right now they never heard of it the risk is someone gets cancer that's listening to this or someone has cancer that that's listening to this I mean statistically there's a lot of people listening to this that have cancer right now and they're speaking to their doctor and their doctor is saying chemotherapy radiation therapy etc etc gluc glucose has nothing to do with tumor eat whatever you want yeah and so what' you say to those people who are they've just got a DI agnosis um and their doctors are saying right listen this is pretty bad severe we're going to suggest that you take chemotherapy yeah you're not telling them not to take chemotherapy are you I'm not telling them that and what we found what we found is that when you are in uh nutritional ketosis with a glucose keto index of 2.0 or below my colleagues that we work with in Istanbul Turkey were able to show that chemotherapies at much lower dosages can be even more therapeutically powerful when you're in nutritional ketosis so you don't have to get rid of a lot of these different procedures that we have today I'm just saying radiation for brain cancer I'm not saying radiation for lung or some of the other cancers okay because if you can if you can shrink those tumors down and make them very weak and vulnerable a surgical procedure a radiation procedure even lowd dose chemo could come in and even immunotherapy if you if you took a big tumor and shrunk it down to a small small nub and it's resistant to a lot of the things they all have to share something in common for them to survive have this this path that might be an immunotherapy could come in because they're going to Target whatever all of them have together and you could possibly get rid of it that way I'm thinking of a friend of mine that um has been diagnosed with brain cancer brain tumor and this is one of the most you know it's a it's a woman in her 40s or 50s trying to keep her Anonymous as possible um who is just the most fit athletic person that I I know eats amazingly well is literally known for exercise um and I'd go how how is it possible that someone who I would probably say is fitter than I am if you looked at their sort of metabolic Health has got a severe brain tumor well it it they can stay healthy for uh and I'm not saying everybody who has and it depends on what kind of a tumor it is as well is it a gly blastoma alod dendral Goma you know Panet there's a lot of different kinds of tumors that want to know that it's it's not growing necessarily but it's big and it's in the brain and they're going to remove for surgical operation well if they can what we always suggest for the brain cancer if you do metabolic therapy up front and I've had uh surgeons tell me this uh you can shrink it down because one of the um one it's angry it's an angry thing right and you can see some slight Invasion if you can shrink that down so that it's more circumscribed now the surgeon can look at and go oh my God we we know uh many many scientific Publications the more you can debolt that's called the removal of the tumor debulking the longer the patient will survive the evidence is massive to support that but you know with a lot of these brain tumors you don't get it all and there's always some little piece that remains and when you irradiate you explode the ability to the cells to ferment energy and it's very hard to kill them but but if you can get the majority of it out and then transition the patient back into a metabolic State keeping the pressure on those tumor cells you can remain healthy like Pablo I mean these these guys can and when you found in mice is that when ketogenic diet was combined with a hyperbaric oxygen therapy the average survival time was increased by roughly 80% yeah even more sometimes now but what okay so why do we hyper do hyperbaric oxygen right that's the question what's going on with hyperbaric oxygen why is this like a good thing it works best when the patient and the mouse is in nutritional ketosis okay so look we have a tumor we iriate that tumor how does the radiation kill the tumor cells it hits oxygen blows up and it causes a reactive R and it's like a a stepping on a landmine it blows the tumor up right so um cancer cells protect themselves even though they make a lot of rust they all they're this close to death anyway but they have a very powerful antioxidant system and interestingly enough that besides causing the disregulated growth the glucose and the glutamine also protect them to some extent from the Ross that they're making and can you believe this the Ross r r reactive oxygen species that are carcinogenic and mutogenic so they're they destroy our our our proteins lipids and and nucleic acids they're disruptive molecules so radiation will cause a Ross in the micro environment Ros that'll blow up and kill cells normal and and tumor cells but but if you want to selectively kill tumor cells you with Ross Not to cause your hair to fall out your gums to bleed and all this crazy stuff you take the patient you put him in nutritional ketosis and you say he's l a low gki then you go into hyperbaric oxygen which dissolves oxygen directly into your blood now it's better than just breathing 100% oxygen because you can actually dissolve oxygen in the bloodstream then you're taking away the two fuels that protect the tumor and you're giving it internal Ross which kills the tumor internally only to the tumor cell not to your surrounding tissues so you're killing selectively killing tumor cells without collateral damage to your to the rest of your body as a matter of fact the rest of your cells are getting super healthy because they're burning ketones in pure oxygen unbelievable how do we measure if our um can you believe this I can't even believe I'm saying this stuff myself you really got to know the biochemistry and you have to know the physiology of your own body and you have to understand evolutionary biology most people just aren't that intelligent including me it's not intelligence most people most people kind of want things sort of simple principles that they can live by and Implement and also quick and easy yeah of course okay they don't want to do what I'm talking about it because it might be or the other thing let me tell you one thing and remember it if you do metabolic therapy success rides heavily on your shoulders you're not sitting there like some Pawn with mannequin some guy's poison and radiating you to to make metabolic therapy work you are the one doing the gki you're the one in your it's your soul it's your you're responsible for your existence on this planet you're G to put your your precious soul in the hands of someone who has less of a knowledge about the the problem than than you might as an entrepreneur I'm always looking for ways to connect and to create and that's why I decided to launch the conversation cards I turned to Shopify who also sponsored this podcast and Shopify made it so easy to set up an online store and

be predisposed genetically to cancer yeah that's what those germine mutations but you can manage that people think you know my my grandmother had breast cancer my mother had breast cancer so yeah you know they live in a common environment too it's not like you're like in order to prove that you you you and all the siblings would have to be raised in a different environment different countries different Lifestyles and then see if you all got cancer at the same time under all these different conditions that's definitely genetic that's like Huntington's disease tayac disease or these kinds of things they'll manifest regardless of the environment so you saying to me that I should as a 32y old man that's cancer-free um God willing I think God touchwood um I should calorie restrict myself to keep my mitochondria healthy and my metabolism healthy now I should be in a in a sort of restri I say it's good to visit the state our Paleolithic ancestors had no choice there wasn't a doughnut shop on every corner there wasn't pizzas there were there weren't the kinds of Highly processed carbohydrate Foods available to them so should I be fasting should I be doing keto I you know I don't want to tell you what you should or should not do I'm not a physician here I'm a scientist I study what causes these things and I study how to manage them you have to read what I'm saying and you have to come to your own decisions about how you want to conduct your life I've given you information what's your view on fasting fasting is a powerful uh way to get your body into nutritional ketosis but it ain't easy try doing it try you try doing it see how how easy it it ain't easy right uh but that's why we developed this procedure where if you go um rather than going cold turkey uh say well today I'm gonna have a big I'm G eat as much as I can and then tomorrow okay you can go the I can it's the second third days when you start to really know what the hell is going on believe me I've tried it it's It Ain't Easy that's why we developed uh a zero carb diet for 14 days 10 to 14 days just zero eat meat fish chicken whatever you want but just don't eat any bread pasta this kind of thing on keto um how do we get into that sort of ketosis state that people often talk about measure your glucose Ketone index how do do that with the the the keto Mojo meter you can buy it from Amazon okay okay you can buy now don't forget they get a free Libra meter now for the blood they're working on Ketone blood meters but it's not there yet right now the keto Mojo or some other keto meters where you could take a prick your finger like a diabetic you take a glucose strip and you put it on the blood and you put it into the machine it tells you what your glucose is squeeze your finger a little bit more take the Ketone strip touch it to the blood put it in the meter it gives you the Ketone value push the button gki comes right up okay okay very simple everybody can buy it from from Amazon get the meter buy the consumables uh and then they can test it this is what Pablo this is what all the the cancer patients the ones who really want to get into metabolic ketosis I think I've tried keto before and I say think because I didn't measure my my keto level I was assuming I did yeah no it's really people say well I haven't eaten you know I'm in ketos how do you know well I blew into this thing and the bulb came out I peed on a strip it looked like it was ketosis they are indirect measures the most accurate is the blood measure so um it's hard to stay in that state for most people right this is one of the things because the Temptations in our society are so strong yeah I mean Paleolithic man had no choice do you think he that was his State that's all he knew for thousands and thousands tens of thousand hundreds of thousands of years that's all he knew he didn't say let me go down to get a big jelly fil donnut down at the at the end of the the river there no there's none of that he had to live in that state now we have so many Temptations all the things that we are biologically clear for when you see obesity that's evolution in action they are the descendants of our long ancestors that could hold on to energy so efficiently we were an energy starved species for the majority of our existence on the planet so anything we ate would be very little we never pee out glucose glucose is converted to fat and we store energy as fat so those guys are energy efficient human beings now all of a sudden we find oursel with everything and that's Evolution and action man that we're just we're just you're allowing to see the how we can store energy so efficiently because our ancestors liveed through such um environmental forcing we had famines we had long TRS we our body could store energy so efficiently because it wasn't we had to store what little we could get from the environment now you've got you know 300 million Americans in this food environment where when when they walk out their front door they see the Dunkin Donut they can lie in bed and order a Dunkin Donut to their front during 10 minutes you don't even have to unas the car they hand it through the window yeah no energy no energy expenditure energy in so so you know giving them this information might be fairly futile because the tempt well that's I'm not here to tell people again I'm not here to tell people what they should or should not do I'm just here to explain like why do we have all this not mystery it's all biological evolution you understand biological evolution almost everything that I'm talking about makes perfect sense um and unfortunately that's not part of our scientific literacy anymore so we need what discipline discipline is important um discipline is important um you know every major religion had had a point of fasting um to be whether you're Islamic Judaism or whatever Catholicism Hinduism whatever I don't whatever they always had some sort of fasting why why you do fasting because you want to purify your body you want to become closer to God you want to you want to you want to feel in control uh and that's always part and if you do it with prayer it's even better so uh there was a reason for doing all that and uh people realized the Ancients uh knew this kind of thing but uh we don't do that anymore uh we don't go 40 days without food like Jesus did in the deserts um but a human being you could absolutely do that I I know because I can look at your weight I can look at your size and I can pretty much tell you how long you can go with before you died and how do I know that because George Cahill a good friend late George kale ran the D jlin diabetes center and he he he evaluated people that would just could water only fasting on until until death and um and some of those conon MA prison and things so he was able to know how much you could how long you could go now what about um Angus barbar went 377 days uh without food George Cahill would fast some of these obese people for for 250 300 days what happens inside their body with with they're burning fat so what happens is you burn fat okay liver stores a lot of of um bone store the minerals that you can get minerals from your bones you can get a lot of fat storage um vitamins are stored in fat a lot of vitamin D outside of the weight loss what's going on in you know we said PE religious people used to fast to get closer to God yeah which seems to me to point to some sort of cognitive change yes and that's from burning ketones yeah burn when you burn K I said in the brain when your brain starts shifting to ketones your energy uh the bang for the buck for each calorie that comes in from a ketone body increases the efficiency of oxidative phosphorilation so you more focused massively and you know this is why our ancestors with the way that if you're if you are dependent on killing some animal uh for your survival and you are out on the hunt you are focused uh because if you're not focused you're going to starve to death so every organ sense organ in our body is super is super jacked when you're in these ketotic states so and these guys walking around with headphones listen you know all this I mean this is like depriving ourselves of the natural ways uh of our ancestry don't forget we're not just you and I are not just here over the last you know 100 300 400 years we are the descendants of members that are same as us you know hundreds of thousands of years ago they were they just didn't have the technology that we have today but if you could brought a Paleolithic man from say 500,000 years ago and you gave him a bunch of donuts and told a he would die went to heaven you mean to tell me I don't have to go out and kill the elk anymore they're going to hand me the food right through the window of course he's going to do that you go in the cave and you throw a bunch of jelly fil Donuts into a bunch of Caven who been chewing on the half eaten rat or something you think they're not going to eat those jelly donuts they have a some chimpanzees live with a family down in Florida I know some YouTube thing The Chimps they're eating the food with the family and then they give jelly sandwiches to The Chimps banging on the table you think they were going to go crazy chimpanzees loving the jelly sandwiches do you have kids yes what advice would you give to your children if they're listening to this now about um how to prevent their chance of getting sick from cancer or these other well they probably say well Dad how come you don't do a lot of the things first of all I'm not telling I told you I don't tell anybody what to do or or how they do it I'm just telling you the science behind why why things work um yeah my my my my my children my two sons and my um they're all very very successful and uh they they said if we ever got cancer we would be doing your we would be doing metabolic therapy if we were to ever get cancer and I said just keep you know exercise and and do what you can do the best you can in our environment I mean don't get me wrong I'm eat I'm eating a jelly donut I'm drinking beer I'm drinking whiskey why because I like it but I'm not going to be doing it all the time you know it's just it's just I'm not going to be saying oh I'm going to eat pizza sure but I'm not going to be uh uh not doing it I do water I do intermittent fasting I don't eat for 18 20 hours at a time I do a lot of exercise over at the university the gym and the facilities that we have um but I but I understand and then if I were to get cancer I would have to um bite the bullet and do what I'm do what I know works as much as it wouldn't be pleasurable but it would be certainly a better alternative than being radiated and poisoned I'm telling you that if that has built your conviction to the point that you're so convinced that the real issue is this sort of metabolic dysfunction um why aren't you optimizing your life to be sort of metabolically perfect well because I live in the same Society you do yeah okay and and fortunately yes our technology has improved uh significantly um you know I'm not a monk I'm not going to be in some Monastery you know chanting something um I I I am a member of the society just as you are and I enjoy the things that we have to offer us to make our lives a little bit more pleasurable there's nothing like sitting down over a nice meal and having a discussion with some wine and enjoying it and en jooy the moment but don't but not to be locked into that kind of uh diet and lifestyle all the time uh puts you at risk there's an election going on in the United States at the moment Trump versus Camala Harris um if you won the election and you became president of the United States and you had to introduce some regulations or some laws around food and all of these kinds of things what would you do well I I think you know you're were talking about a food industry you're talking about a multi-dimensional economy I I would not again you don't want government to tell you what you should do you should make the choices but you have to recognize are there are there choices and what are these choices right now we're not in and we're not seeing or understanding uh how things harm people if if we have an obesity epidemic and that would put you at risk for all these horrific chronic diseases why do they not know that we we introduced some regulation in the UK regarding smoking so you can't smoke inside anymore well that's but do you see this your secondhand smoke can impact negatively the person sitting next to you this uh uh obese person's personal choice to be obese is not going to make you obese or sick so this is a different kind of a situation um it that has to come from internal to the person and they have to be concerned with their own health what about drugs though like cocaine is not legal so why can't they intervene to say you can't have Dunkin Donuts um because they're both you know gonna harm the indivual I think you'd get a revolution if you can't eat a Dunkin Donut you were not going to get a revolution if you can't have C you try take go down here in Brooklyn and take away all these Donuts from people you know you're going to see they're going to go you know it's it's like it's personal choices I I I I like Dunkin Donut I mean I like the coffee especially but um but you can go to donnut shop and get some of these crawlers and jelly fills and Honey Dipped are you kidding me these things are delicious you ever get these blueberry muffins you tremble while you eat some of this stuff you know it's and I'm not going to take that away from me but if I want one I'm not going to be oh every day I got to eat no I just don't eat it I on the weekend I might get one and even sometimes two or three weeks months go by before I'll get one you know but uh but when you get it man you enjoy it you really love it are you hopeful I am very hopeful because PE when the science comes you can't suppress the truth it's going to come out the evidence the scientific evidence is there I'm documenting this scientific and it's based on the shoulders of OT warberg are you kidding me I mean this was a giant in the field of biochemistry it's not like I made this stuff up I'm just extending what he has done to a new dimension and putting it into a practical application which he had never done so it's just an extension of of of the knowledge base o over this time why' you care so much why do I care so much you know I'm not in it for the you know what I'm in it for I want to see the the scientific principles substantiated if you know that you can keep these people alive at a higher quality of life based on the knowledge of the science that's doing that that's gratification man it's gratification to know that these if because because you arise on understanding the mechanism of the problem and if you say you know if we do it the way we're writing a big treatment protocol as we speak it's review a really comprehensive treatment protocol and we Institute that in the clinic and for G blastoma patients and these Advanced cancers they're not they're not living a few extra months they're living several years longer why because you knew the science what's wrong with that that's that's gratification you don't have to make a billion dollars on that all you have to know is that all those folks are living longer because you understood the science that was put into practical application what's WR that's our our research is supported by philanthropy and private foundations that money allows me to to to do these experiments to test what I'm testing on pre-clinical models and then we translate it back into the clinic directly and we see like Pablo Kelly he should have been done he should have been done years and years ago he lived all those years extra he's had a wife and he's got kids he didn't have to have his sperm Frozen he didn't have to have any of that stuff done what's wrong with that keep I'm seeing people that are should have been dead a long time ago and they're still alive and they're saying I'm doing fine I get calls from people geez I thought that guy would have been a goner he's still alive he's doing well I said that that keeps me going because it tells me that we're on the right path this is a solvable problem this cancer this cancer can be dropped significantly you can take away the fear people now put the put it on their shoulders I know what to do how to do it I'm going to follow this will it work for everybody no well it will help a lot of people much more than what we have today but it's Paradigm change massive paradigm change so uh they will come to know it's just a matter of time I don't know how long it's going to take but I ain't going anywhere I'm continuing to do this I'm going to get better and better results and we're going to keep pushing I published these case reports in the scientific literature let the scientific field uh make their decision on the results from these papers and if you are to succeed what happens people improve um what I'm not going to live forever so but I know that what I've done with with following Auto warberg and cleaning up the misconceptions and misunderstanding of why he he was stalled when the field ran off chasing jeans we got to bring bring it back on track it's a metabolic problem with metabolic U Solutions so that will help a lot of people but it's also going to change a lot of way people are thinking about this but I I can tell you they want to open clinics I get calls from from Asia Africa South America they want to open clinics people are being brutalized by a system that's not working don't forget besides the terrible Financial tox the personal physical toxicity people have gone bankrupt their marriages are falling apart because they can't pay for the expensive drugs on these cancer things and they die and the bills are passed on to their level this is immoral stuff is there a particular case study that's broken your heart more than any others Trudy Dupont who originally let me we we built a glucose Ketone index calculator on her Pablo is I'm still we're still ated by Pablo's loss because Pablo was a a guy that I've known for 10 years worked him through and then all of a sudden he gets a cerebral hem and dies he was our poster child for how long you could live with a gleo blastoma on metabolic therapy but he didn't die from the cancer um yeah have there's some others that we wished they could have lived a little bit longer uh with the appropriate help what I find is that sometimes within the family there's a lot of the guy he's I really want to do what you're doing but my wife and kids saying I'm foolish to do that so it's it's still a very we're in a very early stage of this we haven't really worked it out into a an effective standard yet it will come so people and the other members of the family get super help when they all work together and they do it everybody says I never felt so healthy in my life um gu tanom had Advanced prostate cancer he wrote a book and he's on the web and he had hypertension high blood pressure overweight more obesity and all everything and then he does uh 18 several 18-day water only fasts got himself everything all these things went away his diabetes went away his hypertension high blood pressure and the cancer can't be found so is he cured I have no idea but but he's managed yes he's managed and he's healthier so what's wrong with that isn't that isn't that ultimately what medicine wants to do keep people alive longer and a healthier quality of life yeah how many more do we need they say oh that's a fluke that's a fluke that's a fluke that's a fluke that's a fluke how many damn flukes do you want if there's someone listening now and I'm sure there's going to be many thousands and tens of thousands of people listening um that are currently battling cancer have early stage diagnosis I know I feel bad about this because people say oh I want to do medicab bolic therapy where can I go and they go to their local hospital and get slapped down there's no evidence there's everything that's should come out of my mouth has never been taught to me in medical school so what do you say to those people you know I say I I say the I I'm sorry that the medical establishment has not come to recognize what I'm saying and then I tell them WR your c i i you know it's it's the change has to be coming from the people ain't going to come from the top medical schools they they are doing what they're doing very the status quo is very profitable the status quo is very effective for these people but it's not helping the cancer patient uh as well as it can and don't forget we're not throwing out all this stuff we're just asking people to know how to use the tools we have in a better way we don't have to throw out immunotherapies radiation we don't have to throw out toxic poisons we just have to know better how to use it when the patient is in this new state and the data will prove it but who's going to do that who's going to do that the doctor says I'd love to do this if I but I'm going to lose my license if I do it what what's going on with that they wrote the standard of care as if it were in granted can't be changed no it should be flexible when new evidence comes I don't believe your evidence what number do you not believe what what piece of science do you not believe on this well I haven't read it they you can't be right when 99% of the world says it's this way and you're saying it's something different that's confirmation bias you're not looking at the numbers and then when they get cancer they come hey what can you do for me you know it's like it's like that but yes it has to change it will change because we're on the momentum to move it it's people are coming to know this and once the change happens it's going to be like a a major major change and people people are going to have to just readjust Thomas we have a closing tradition on this podcast where the last guest leaves a question for the next guest not knowing who they're going to be leaving it for and the question that's been left for you is imagine the end of your life your closest friends and family are at your funeral what do you imagine or hope you he changed the course of cancer it that's it Dr Thomas seed that is exactly what you're doing and I think that's an extremely you know I can't even find a word that describes the profundity of such a mission um because so many people are struggling with cancer as if it is this sort of opaque black box of a disease that strikes us at random and picks on people like roulette um and debilitates their lives out of the blue and having more information out there about the root causes of these issues turns the lights on and allows us to go in search of better solutions to what has always been a really really complex hard to understand disease your work runs almost entirely I believe on philanthropic donations right that's right so that's people that um they make donations to both the my University Boston College which is a Jesuit university in Chestnut Hill Massachusetts and we we follow the Jesuit philosophy of service to others predominantly um and uh private foundations so if someone wants to make a donation where do they go do they go to your website I know there's a donation button there uh they they go primarily to our University they can just um they have a on my on my University biology web page there's a donation button and Travis christopherson's foundation for metabolic cancer therapies which is a 503 uh Foundation he he supports our research through philanthropic donations to his foundation I would um urge anyone that wants to support your mission to go to your University website there's a donation button there which I saw it earlier on click that button and they can make a donation if they that's right and and and and that and and Travis Christ christopherson's Foundation okay which is the foundation for cancer metabolic therapies it's a 503 uh Foundation Travis christopherson's when people email me I send them the the links to those to those found I cannot accept personally any money from anybody okay that's one thing that's one thing I'm not here so people say oh I want to give you money to do it no no no I can't you have to give it to the university that comes through me through the appropriate channels to support my research through the university Dr Thomas C thank you so much for your time today and I'm I'm I'm hugely inspired and um enlightened by everything we've discussed and I think there's a bunch of very straightforward practical things I'll be implementing in my life specifically buying one of those bloody machines so that I can keep on in my GK index yeah gki gki index yeah glucose Ketone index well listen thank you very much for having me here because your your programs and others um alert people to know that there are alternatives effective Alternatives and once the system changes uh the outcomes will not be so Bleak as we currently have them [Music] today isn't this cool every single conversation I have here on the D at the very end of it you'll know I ask the guest to leave a question in the Diary of a CEO and what we've done is we've turned every single question written in the Diary of a CEO into these conversation cards that you can play at home so you've got every guest we've ever had their question and on the back of it if you scan that QR code you get to watch the person who answered that question we're finally revealing all of the questions and the people that answered the question the brand new version 2 updated conversation cards are out right now at Theon conversation cards.com they've sold out twice instantaneously so if you are interested in getting hold of some limited edition conversation cards I really really recommend acting quickly oh

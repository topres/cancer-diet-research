### Objectives
- Fact-check 26 claims made about cancer metabolism, ketogenic diet, and metabolic therapy
- Evaluate evidence quality using peer-reviewed scientific literature
- Identify areas of scientific consensus vs. controversy
- Document contradictory evidence where it exists

### Evidence Quality Scale

- **🥉 Limited**: Case-control studies, animal studies, mechanistic studies
- **⚠️ Very Limited**: Case reports, in vitro studies, expert opinion

### Assessment Categories
- **✅ SUPPORTED**: Strong evidence supports the claim
- **⚖️ PARTIALLY SUPPORTED**: Some evidence supports, with important caveats
- **❌ NOT SUPPORTED**: Evidence contradicts or doesn't support the claim
- **❓ INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE**: Not enough quality evidence to determine
- **🔍 COMPLEX**: Mixed evidence requiring nuanced interpretation

## Research Priorities

### **Phase 1: Core Metabolic Mechanisms** (Claims 1-4) ✅ 75% Complete

Calorie restriction, fasting, specific dietary approaches

### **Phase 5: Case Studies** (Claims 24-26)
Individual success stories and veterinary applications

## Research Notes

### Key Themes Emerging:
1. **Metabolic Complexity**: Cancer metabolism shows significant heterogeneity
2. **Evidence Quality**: Mix of strong epidemiological data and limited clinical trials
3. **Universality Claims**: Statements using "ALL cancers" often oversimplified

### Research Challenges:
- Distinguishing correlation from causation
- Evaluating Dr. Seyfried's specific interpretations vs. broader scientific consensus
- Balancing mechanistic insights with clinical evidence
- Addressing publication bias in metabolic therapy literature

### Next Steps:
1. Complete Phase 1 (Claims 3-4) - ketone metabolism
2. Begin systematic review of ketogenic diet clinical trials
3. Evaluate quality of case studies and anecdotal evidence
